Once upon a time, Smartphones were made to be Mini-Desktop PCs, or at least texting machines. They would be able to run desktop-quality Linux apps on a small screen.

And the Motorola Photon Q 4G LTE was the best of them all. The last great keyboard Android phone.

Those times are now gone. Multitouch screens have all but taken over the market. So this phone is a rare breed.

You can find one of these for just $50 on eBay, and a SIM card modification is available (you can have it soldered on for you for $100).

## Unlock Bootloader

This is one of the first Motorola phones that had an unlockable, unencrypted bootloader. It's pretty easy to do, and after that you can install ClockworkMod or TWRP without a sweat.

> **Note:** If you entered the unlock key incorrectly, you will get an error: _"Your device does not quality for bootloader unlock"._ Don't panic, this is just the default response for invalid codes. You should check that the unlock code is all on one line with no extra spaces, and try again.
