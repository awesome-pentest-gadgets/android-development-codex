### AT&T Users

Most AT&T users should stick to the JB stock radios, since most of the Nexus 4 radios have issues with LTE.

### T-Mobile Users

T-Mobile users will have to get their phone [[SIM-Unlocked|E970 SIM Unlock]] before continuing.

The Nexus 4 and hybrid radios tend to be a better choice for T-Mobile users, since their network generally does not support LTE yet, and compatibility tends to be better.

* [Morrislee's Hybrid Radios](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2412052) - These combine the new power management features of the new radios, with the LTE capability of the old radios.

* .48 - Said to be the best, with minimal data drops and good network. However, LTE is disabled.
