### AT&T Users

Most AT&T users should stick to the JB stock radios, since most of the Nexus 4 radios have issues with LTE.

### T-Mobile Users

T-Mobile users will have to get their phone [[SIM-Unlocked|E970 SIM Unlock]] before continuing.

The Nexus 4 radios tend to be a better choice for T-Mobile users, since their network generally does not support LTE yet, and compatibility tends to be better.
