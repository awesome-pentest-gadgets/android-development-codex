### AT&T Users

Most AT&T users should stick to the JB stock radios, since most of the Nexus 4 radios have issues with LTE.

### T-Mobile Users

T-Mobile users will have to get their phone [[SIM-Unlocked|E970 SIM Unlock]] before continuing.

The Nexus 4 and hybrid radios tend to be a better choice for T-Mobile users, since compatibility tends to be better.

* [Morrislee's Hybrid Radios](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2412052) - These combine the new power management features of the new radios, with the LTE capability of the old radios. You generally do not need to flash the `EnableN4Radio.zip`, unless you've done the Nexus 4 conversion. You could probably use [this to flash, too](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2358931)
* .48 - Said to be the best, with minimal data drops and good network. However, LTE is disabled.

### Enable LTE after Nexus 4 conversion

If you're not using a LGOG-built custom ROM, you will need this.

Go to Settings, Wireless & Networks More, Mobile networks, and change your network mode to “LTE /GSM/WCDMA” (if you don’t see that option, go to your dialer and key in *#*#4636#*#*, tap WCDMA under “Set preferred network type”, then select “LTE/GSM/CDMA auto (PRL)”).
