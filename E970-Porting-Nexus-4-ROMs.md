Because the hardware of the Optimus G E970 is almost identical to the Nexus 4, ROMs from the Nexus 4's massive ROM development scene can be easily ported over to the Optimus G. 

This is a safer and better alternative to a full transformation into a Nexus 4, but requires more knowledge and a bit of work for each ROM you want.
