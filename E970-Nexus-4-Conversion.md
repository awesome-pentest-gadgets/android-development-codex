This mod completely converts your LG Optimus G (AT&T E970 Only) into a Nexus 4. After the conversion, any mod or custom ROM that can be installed to the Nexus 4 will work on your LGOG, including the following:

* **Stock Nexus 4 ROM** - The stock Nexus 4 ROM can recieve OTA (Over-the-air) system updates from Google, giving you the very latest Android version.
* **Nexus 4 Custom ROMs** - ROMs with special features, found on XDA. Nexus 4 Custom ROMs include CyanogenMod, ParanoidAndroid, AOKP, PACman, OmniROM, etc.
* **Nexus 4 Custom Kernels** - Some kernels give improved performance, improved battery life, or extra features.
* **MultiROM** - Allows you to dual-boot (or triple boot or whatnot) Android ROMs, Ubuntu Touch, Firefox OS, etc.
* **Any other modification or zip compatible with the Nexus 4**

## Warning

There are many different variants of the Optimus G (E973, E975, etc), but **only the AT&T (E970) variant** uses the exact same hardware as the Nexus 4. **Do not use this conversion with any other variant**, you will brick your phone.

This mod works by using LGNPST to replace the stock LGOG partition scheme with one compatible with the Nexus 4. Since this mod replaces the stock bootloader, it is **far riskier** than a typical ROM flash. The LGOG has a few extra features and quirks, which need to be fixed with zip mods.

Generally, if your phone doesn't run out of power or get disconnected during the process, things will be okay, and afterwards, the modification is completely reversible using LGNPST. However, **you are ultimately responsible for anything that happens to your device.**

And before embarking on this difficult journey, you should first check out the [LGOG Android Development forums on XDA](http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=1921) to see if the Custom ROMs there are good enough for you. Most of them are ported from the N4 anyway.
