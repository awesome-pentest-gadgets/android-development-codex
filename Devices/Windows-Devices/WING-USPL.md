Notice: The new [[WING HardSPL|HardSPL]] method is recommended over this one. This guide is just kept for archival purposes.

## USPL Flash Instructions

1. [[WING Custom ROMs|Download the ROM you want to use from here.]]
1. Unzip or unrar the downloaded `.NBH` file into the `RUU` folder inside the `Flash Center` folder
1. Make sure that you have the `.NBH` file in the `RUU` folder and not within another folder
1. Put your phone into flight mode (Not necessary, but it's recommended)
1. Connect your phone to your computer via USB and make sure ActiveSync is connected
1. Go into your `Flash Center` folder and run herald-uspl.exe
1. Follow the instructions as closely as possible on the command prompt that appears.
1. Your screen on your cell phone will go white around the 75% part of the "second step" now. ActiveSync will LOSE its connection. *This is normal behavior.*
1. Once it says it's finished, your phone will restart and you will have your new ROM!
