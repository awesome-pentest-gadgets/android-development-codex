The HTC Herald/T-Mobile Wing is a relic of an older, simpler time, when XDA Developers actually worked on XDA Windows Mobile phones, displaying a distinct culture quite different from the past.

However, that history is slowly fading, and if no attempt is made to save it, link rot will have destroyed nearly all the work that XDA was so famous for in the past; not to mention killing off these older devices.

This guide will be the first in a long movement to archive and liquidate the glories of XDA's long history with Windows Mobile devices.
