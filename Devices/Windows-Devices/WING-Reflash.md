Before installing a HardSPL, you must to have an IPL version `4.xx` or higher. This can be obtained by installing the latest RUUs from HTC.

And if you don't like your custom ROMs, or your phone seems to be bricked, you can always use the RUU to restore your phone to it's original state.

## Check SPL/IPL version

1. Hold the **Volume Down** button, and keep holding it while pressing and releasing the **Soft Reset** button. 
2. Continue holding **Volume Down** until you see a new "colorscreen", which will have the version numbers. 
3. To exit it, just press and release the **Soft Reset** button again.

## Models

First, you'll need to identify which model you use. Since HTC was a second-rate OEM at the time, this particular model was released worldwide under differing brands and names.

* **T-Mobile Wing** - America only, offered by T-Mobile. Has T-Mobile logo on top, and blue suede all over.
* **XDA Terra** - Britain only, offered by O2. It's black and has the Xda logo at the top-right.
* **HTC P4350 Herald** - Worldwide, black color with either HTC branding or any other carrier name. 

Once identified, check the guides below for the RUU links.
