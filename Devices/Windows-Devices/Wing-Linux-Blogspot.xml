I promise!  We've just...slowed down a bit.  I think things will start to pick up soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what's been keeping us for so long?  Well, this is a volunteer project, primarily run by one.  And that one has been REALLY REALLY busy lately.  So, unfortunately not much has been done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the linwizard folks have been working pretty steadily on LCD detection code that we hope will ease the inclusion of all those board files we wrote in our kernel sprint into the mainline kernel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To that end, they've posted a &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=AANLkTinKMJb_7QiBwMsFEjwV4vc4rFLxxsJEmRv6T8hs%40mail.gmail.com"&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; on their mailing list -- go check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More kernel patches continue to be merged upstream, and we're slowly closing in towards not needing to maintain our own kernel tree anymore.  However, with only one or two of us working on this, it's hard to keep it going sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as a 0.5.0 release goes, there's no timeframe for that at the moment.  Since most of our work lately has focused on the kernel, we don't have very many user-visible features in place right now (and we haven't been working on much of that either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, more than ever, if you or anyone you know is a developer and would like to get in on this stuff, feel free!  The code is out there, free for the taking and hacking on.  The only way we can go faster is with more time or hands, and time is hard to come by.  So please, help out if you can!  (Hint hint, Android work is there for the taking -- we're all doing kernel work right now :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The documentation on our site &lt;b&gt;should&lt;/b&gt; be enough to get you going with a checkout.  If you run into trouble, though, please let us know so we can fix/extend the documents.  I want to make this as easy for people to get into as possible, so please let me know what I can do to that end!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy hacking!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1140104932379868918-203974082054076036?l=wing-linux.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://wing-linux.blogspot.com/2010/11/wing-linux-sleeping-robot.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (darkstar62)</author><thr:total>14</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1140104932379868918.post-6940615354945664786</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2010 18:06:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2010-08-01T11:06:26.110-07:00</atom:updated><title>Kernel Sprint a Huge Success!</title><description>Well, we had our first ever kernel sprint yesterday, and I'm happy to report that it was a massive success!  We had somewhere around 14 active testers and developers throughout the day, and we got 8 boards successfully ported over and tested!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to everone that participated.  This gets us that much closer to being able to release a new version of Wing Linux, based on the very latest kernel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've still got a lot of work ahead of us, though.  This sprint got us to basic functionality -- we still need things like the touchscreen drivers, GSM, and all the other goodies (hopefully to include sound and camera drivers, among them).  That, and all this has to be accepted upstream.  Whew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, the road to there has shortened quite a bit after yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be wanting to set up another sprint soon to iron out some outstanding Android issues, in particular the GPRS connection problem that plagues so many.  More details on that to come as I plan it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I want to throw out a huge thank you to all that participated yesterday -- you're awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were one of the testers yesterday, please email me with the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your real name&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your email address&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What your IRC nickname was&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd like to collect this information so that when we submit our changes upstream, I can give you credit for testing.  You'll get a line in our commit messages like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre style="margin-left: 40px"&gt;Tested-by: Your Name &amp;lt;your.email@somewhere.com&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This not only helps us get things upstream faster (by giving our reviewers some confidence that the code works), it also gives you credit in the kernel testing history, as well as some google visibility.  I completely understand if you'd rather not submit, but I would definitely encourage you to.  You deserve the credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll have information about the next sprint here in the coming weeks, so stay tuned!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1140104932379868918-6940615354945664786?l=wing-linux.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://wing-linux.blogspot.com/2010/08/kernel-sprint-huge-success.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (darkstar62)</author><thr:total>13</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1140104932379868918.post-8227878322296228694</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2010 03:57:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2010-07-28T20:57:56.561-07:00</atom:updated><title>Wing Linux has a New Web Site!</title><description>So, yeah.  We've got a new site!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a while, we've been graciously using &lt;a href="http://www.sourceforge.net"&gt;SourceForge&lt;/a&gt;'s hosted app functionality for our web site.  However, we've outgrown the capabilities of that service a bit and have switched over to a new web site engine.  We're still hosted on SourceForge, but now we have our own &lt;a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/"&gt;Trac&lt;/a&gt; installation, which lets us do all sorts of neat things, like modify the way tickets work, change themes, add functionality to the wiki, plugins galore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So check it out!  All the old content has been moved over to the new site (including all the history), and if you've been using our main address, you'll go straight there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who don't have it, you can get to us via &lt;a href="http://wing-linux.sourceforge.net"&gt;wing-linux.sourceforge.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's only one downside I can see so far to this transition -- no email notification of changes.  However, that can be mitigated by RSS feed subscriptions.  You can subscribe to three different feeds:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the "Timeline" section, this feed will give you all site activity changes when they happen.  This includes ticket changes, wiki updates, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the "View Tickets" section, this feed will give you updates whenever tickets are added or removed from a report.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Individual ticket changes can be subscribed to with their RSS feeds as well.  If you submit a bug, this is a good feed to subscribe to so you can track the changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, enjoy the new site, lemme know if something goes wrong.  This site, unlike the other one, allows wiki edits by anyone registered (and registration is free and open to anyone, with or without a sourceforge account [please don't abuse it!]).  So feel free to make updates and fix things if you see them.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1140104932379868918-8227878322296228694?l=wing-linux.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://wing-linux.blogspot.com/2010/07/wing-linux-has-new-web-site.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (darkstar62)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1140104932379868918.post-1618734881767308970</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2010 02:26:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2010-07-29T17:26:38.204-07:00</atom:updated><title>Linwizard and Wing Linux Join Forces for Kernel Sprint</title><description>For a while now, we've been slowly making progress in moving our Wing Linux kernel code into mainstream Linux.

The Linwizard project (specifically ali1234 and miknix, thanks!) have worked hard in the last few weeks to organize this event, and we're hoping for a good turnout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what's going to happen -- we're taking the current &lt;a href="http://www.kernel.org/"&gt;mainline Linux tree&lt;/a&gt; and we're porting all the board support drivers we have for all devices in Wing Linux over to it.  What this means in particular is that we will be closer to no longer needing to support our own kernel tree.  This'll mean easier development effort, and faster releases (I'm talking about 0.5 here!), not to mention a much better chance at supporting new Android releases (2.x and beyond).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We want testers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want developers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want anyone interested in the project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is you, join us on IRC this Saturday for a day of hacking, testing, and (hopefully) fun!  Everyone is welcome -- no experience necessary!  So break out your old device and let's see if we can breath new life into it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: For those of you who aren't familiar with IRC, you can join us easily by going &lt;a href="http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=wing-linux%2Clinwizard&amp;uio=d4"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Wow, guess that's one new year's resolution I'm not sticking too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, uh, things have been busy for me, though sadly not with Wing Linux.  In early February we got a new border collie puppy named Rigel.  If you've ever had a puppy, you know how much of a handful they can be.  Even worse if they're a border collie puppy -- they're smart, full of energy, and get into all kinds of trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...Which explains the last couple of months.  Yes, he's cute.  Yes, he's trouble.  Behold:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="385" width="640"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/XszA9FcLdIE&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;"&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/XszA9FcLdIE&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="197" width="320"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, that's four-month old Rigel jumping our baby gate.  He discovered he could do that about two weeks after we got him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as you might imagine, he's been very busy (as have we) with puppy training classes.  He's just finished the first 6-week course of puppy kindergarten and we're in the waiting period for puppy junior high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, this means I haven't had much time at all to devote to this project, and it seems many of the other devs have become very busy themselves.  I really am hoping to be able to get back to it soon, but things aren't looking too promising right now, which is a real shame, because we have a lot of exciting things on the horizon.  We'll see, maybe I'll be able to get into it soon.  As always, help is welcomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I'll be busy turning a rather cute but very energetic puppy into a really sweet dog (which he's rapidly becoming).  And after that: agility!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and by the way, if any of you have or are looking into getting a puppy any time soon, consider going into clicker training.  We were skeptical of it at first, but it has proved to be an amazing technique for training quickly.  We've even taught our other 6-year-old dog new tricks!  Highly recommended.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1140104932379868918-1688828312323815685?l=wing-linux.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://wing-linux.blogspot.com/2010/04/of-puppies-andwell-puppies.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (darkstar62)</author><thr:total>5</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1140104932379868918.post-5753005970147461135</guid><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2010 23:47:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2010-01-31T16:15:05.989-08:00</atom:updated><title>Blog posting: FAIL</title><description>So I apparently fail at keeping an up-to-date blog about my happenings and whatnot, seeing as I haven't posted since Thanksgiving last year.  So, um...Happy holidays, happy new year, and all that stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that out of the way, let's get down to business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot has happened over the past month or two (or three...).   In short:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm now a certified &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29"&gt;Scrum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29"&gt; Master&lt;/a&gt;!  Woo!  For those not familiar with Scrum, it's an Agile methodology for software project management.  I got it primarily for work, but there's a lot of things that can be applied to development in general, I've found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A friend of mine gave me a couple free phones, one of which is an &lt;a href="http://pdadb.net/index.php?m=specs&amp;amp;id=733&amp;amp;c=htc_tytn_ii_p4550_htc_kaiser_120"&gt;HTC Kaiser&lt;/a&gt;.  This thing is neat!  Twice as fast and twice as much memory as my &lt;a href="http://pdadb.net/index.php?m=specs&amp;amp;id=669&amp;amp;c=htc_p4350_htc_herald_100"&gt;HTC Herald&lt;/a&gt;, and runs Android Eclair like a dream!  Don't fear though, I won't be giving up my Wing anytime soon -- I gave the device to my wife, as she's been wanting to try and Android phone for a while.  And, quite frankly, the &lt;a href="http://www.androidonhtc.com/kaiser/install"&gt;Android on HTC&lt;/a&gt; project is just too complete. :)  I did learn something interesting out while working with their project though: They use linux 2.6.25, same as Wing Linux.  Which leads to...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hacking on Android Eclair for Wing Linux is underway.  Having found that we indeed don't need a newer kernel, I've built a test image or two and have been working on making it usable.  Still a ways to go, but pretty neat watching the Nexus One boot splash on my device. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Audio support for Wing Linux is very nearly complete!  This means MP3's, ring tones, and possibly even two-way audio during calls without having to boot in during a call.  Imagine that!  Thanks to everyone who's made this possible (and there's a lot)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two new devices have entered patches for our next version -- the &lt;a href="http://pdadb.net/index.php?m=specs&amp;amp;id=679&amp;amp;c=htc_s710___s711_htc_vox"&gt;HTC Vox&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://pdadb.net/index.php?m=specs&amp;amp;id=358&amp;amp;c=t-mobile_mda_compact_ii_htc_charmer"&gt;HTC Charmer&lt;/a&gt;.  Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our IRC channel, #wing-linux, has reached a record number of users this week at 23!  We're growing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;OK, maybe not that short.  But definitely some cool stuff.  Maybe I can shorten the time between posts here too... :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy hacking!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1140104932379868918-5753005970147461135?l=wing-linux.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://wing-linux.blogspot.com/2010/01/blog-posting-fail.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (darkstar62)</author><thr:total>15</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1140104932379868918.post-6952529419933449204</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2009 02:12:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-11-21T18:34:31.130-08:00</atom:updated><title>Thanksgiving</title><description>Many of you may be wondering where I've been and what I've been up to this last month or so.  Well, the month of November has brought with it a lot of chaos -- where to begin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right off the bat, our dog Pixel managed to get himself lost.  This was late October, but bled into November with our search finally ending on Friday, November 6th, when a kind man picked me up as I was posting lost dog signs.  He drove me around to where he had seen Pixel last, and with the help of several residents around the area, we finally found him, wet, scared, but so very happy to see me.  Hardest.  Week.  Evar.  On the bright side, using Google Earth to track the tips we got made the process much easier.  Still a very hard week though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I found myself with a lot of Wing Linux stuff to do -- putting the final touches on the 0.4 release and getting started on the 0.4.1 (and later 0.4.2) releases.  Not to mention all the upstream work that's been going on (which I'm happy to say has paid off, since it looks like support for HTC Herald will be included in Linux 2.6.33).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, it seems things are finally winding down a bit as we head towards Thanksgiving.  Which I'm SOO anxious for -- we're going to Cancun!  We had been planning to get with friends and host Thanksgiving at home, but that fell through, so we decided to cut our losses and just go on vacation.  Can't wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in light of Thanksgiving's pending arrival, I think it's fitting to talk about some of the things I'm thankful for this year.  The first that comes to mind is that we got our dog back safe and sound -- can't ask for more than that!  I'm thankful to everyone who has made the Wing Linux project the success that it is, and I'm so very thankful that I've survived the layoff cycles at my job (and wish those that haven't the best of luck -- it's a tough market out there now).  But most of all, I'm thankful for my lovely wife Tess and the wonderful life we have together.  She has made everything possible and always brightens my day -- there's  a lot I couldn't do without her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what about you?  What are you thankful for this year?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1140104932379868918-6952529419933449204?l=wing-linux.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://wing-linux.blogspot.com/2009/11/thanksgiving.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (darkstar62)</author><thr:total>4</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1140104932379868918.post-647565625373250371</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2009 02:46:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-09-20T20:12:31.649-07:00</atom:updated><title>Tiny Devices with Linux</title><description>A little while ago I acquired one of &lt;a href="http://www.openplug.org"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;.  It's a cute little embedded ARM computer with some pretty impressive specs.  People owning these things have done everything from running web servers on them all the way up to a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xClCWZ9Nv0A"&gt;full Linux desktop computer&lt;/a&gt;.  Impressive, right?  You bet, especially when you take into account that they use &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;5 watts of power&lt;/span&gt;!  Whoa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things come with &lt;a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/arm"&gt;Ubuntu Jaunty for ARM&lt;/a&gt; pre-installed and ready to roll.  So, what did I do with mine?  Glad you asked!  I've managed to offload most everything I used to use my high-powered HTPC/server for.  It's running my &lt;a href="http://www.mythtv.org/"&gt;MythTV&lt;/a&gt; backend, including wake-on-lan support for my HTPC (which now is off most of the time), running an IRC bot (wingnut on #wing-linux, you may have met him!), and managing my private domain so I can SSH in at will.  I've even got a copy of &lt;a href="http://www.apache.org/"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt; running on it, serving &lt;a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/MythWeb"&gt;MythWeb&lt;/a&gt;, a web plug-in for MythTV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love tiny little ARM computers, especially with Linux on them.  They're a lot of fun to work with, a challenge to program for, and it's simply amazing what you can make them do.  Even with all that, I've still got a lot of horsepower left over to use.  Just gotta figure out what to make it do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the Wing Linux front, things are well and moving steadily.  Our latest &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wing-linux/"&gt;0.4pre4&lt;/a&gt; development release seems to be a hit; lots of good results, few bugs reported so far.  Sounds like we're getting close to releasing 0.4.  We've now got 11 supported devices, with more on the horizon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've also been working hard with the &lt;a href="http://linwizard.sf.net"&gt;Linwizard&lt;/a&gt; project bringing our kernel changes to the main-line kernel.  So far, we've got a kernel booting with SD card support, up from not having any omap850 support at all.  We're still waiting on our patches to be approved, but I'm hopeful we'll get them in soon.  This work will give us lots of new things for our project, one of which is long-awaited sound support and wifi -- not to mention all the work on power management that's been done since our kernel was released.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of good stuff coming -- Stay tuned!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1140104932379868918-647565625373250371?l=wing-linux.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://wing-linux.blogspot.com/2009/09/tiny-devices-with-linux.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (darkstar62)</author><thr:total>3</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1140104932379868918.post-3775198672116951524</guid><pubDate>Mon, 31 Aug 2009 21:08:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-08-31T20:19:52.275-07:00</atom:updated><title>Woo!  Vacation!  Woo!</title><description>Well, I just returned from vacation, and man am I feeling refreshed!  Pretty short stint out, but well worth it nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in the great Northwest is amazing, especially when things like the San Juan islands are practically in your back yard.  As you might imagine, that's where we spent the weekend.  We went on a two-day sea-kayaking trip that took us from Friday Harbor around many of the islands there, finally stopping at Stuart Island.  We set up camp there and took a nice 5-mile hike to a beautiful view of the sunset, overlooking the sound.  It was, well, see for yourself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_cB3yf--vU3E/Spw-UN8wTmI/AAAAAAAAAGY/wCr7M508JGY/s1600-h/P8290074.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_cB3yf--vU3E/Spw-UN8wTmI/AAAAAAAAAGY/wCr7M508JGY/s320/P8290074.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5376240572236320354" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, we saw Orcas!  Lots of 'em!  We didn't manage to get any good pictures of them, but someone else in our group did.  I'll post some of them up once we have them.  Also, starfish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_cB3yf--vU3E/Spw_f4g2wgI/AAAAAAAAAGg/UP34TtOV8eM/s1600-h/P8290063.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_cB3yf--vU3E/Spw_f4g2wgI/AAAAAAAAAGg/UP34TtOV8eM/s320/P8290063.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5376241872152216066" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;All credit goes to my lovely wife Tess for the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now that we're back home, we'll be getting back into things as usual.  Some good news to report on the Wing Linux end, it looks like HTC Opal and HTC Pharos support is coming along nicely, with touchscreen support having been implemented by their respective developers.  Take a look at the forums for the &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/wing-linux/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;amp;t=16"&gt;Pharos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/wing-linux/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;amp;t=6"&gt;Opal&lt;/a&gt; to get in on some of that.  Also, the &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/wing-linux/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;amp;t=14&amp;amp;start=10"&gt;Excalibur&lt;/a&gt; development has progressed, with a working directional pad now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're looking to put out a fourth development release of 0.4 pretty soon -- hopefully we can get the Pharos, Opal, and new Excalibur support in.  Also, Elf and Elfin owners will be happy to learn the latest development kernel code fixes all issues with the keypad.  Check &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/wing-linux/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;amp;t=7&amp;amp;start=110"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for Elf development, and also the new xda-developers thread started &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=554479"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Lots of good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, our project is going to take a little of a direction change.  Up to now, we've been on the 2.6.25 kernel, holding things pretty steady.  But we'd like to get our stuff moved into the main-line kernel so we don't have to keep maintaining separate development efforts from main kernel work.  So, after the next development release, we're going to start working hard with the &lt;a href="http://linwizard.sf.net/"&gt;linwizard&lt;/a&gt; project (who's work made our project possible) to get all the changes we've made pushed into the main-line kernel.  We'll still accept patches against the 2.6.25 kernel and keep that going, but we're going to focus our attention more at the upstream port work.  Should be fun, and it should get us a better path towards upgrading to Android Donut -- not to mention things like power management, sound, and wifi support for a bunch of devices (hopefully).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, stay tuned. :)&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1140104932379868918-3775198672116951524?l=wing-linux.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://wing-linux.blogspot.com/2009/08/woo-vacation-woo.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (darkstar62)</author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_cB3yf--vU3E/Spw-UN8wTmI/AAAAAAAAAGY/wCr7M508JGY/s72-c/P8290074.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1140104932379868918.post-1725762755440313588</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Aug 2009 20:01:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-08-15T13:44:45.355-07:00</atom:updated><title>Releases, Devices, Support, Oh My!</title><description>It's been rather hectic lately for the Wing Linux project since we did our most recent development release.  What started as a small little project to try and get Linux and Android running on a Herald has turned into seemingly something much bigger -- we've got requests coming in for all kinds of device support now.  Gene, Artemis, Opal, Elf and Elfin...whew!  Sometimes I find myself having trouble keeping up with it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...Especially being one of the only developers on the project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that the focus of the project has opened up a bit, I'm finding it more and more difficult to keep up.  I posted a &lt;a href="https://sourceforge.net/people/viewjob.php?group_id=253356&amp;amp;job_id=33125"&gt;help wanted&lt;/a&gt; on Sourceforge recently for anyone willing to put in some time to maintain the project for their particular device.  If you're reading this and thinking you'd like to help, check it out -- I could use all the help I can get.  Even help with answering questions on the forums would take a huge load off of me, but if you can write a little C code and are intersted in learning, we'd be glad to have you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're looking to start supporting more and more devices in the future.  There's a lot of OMAP850-based devices out there, and I can't do it alone.  Care to join? :)&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1140104932379868918-1725762755440313588?l=wing-linux.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://wing-linux.blogspot.com/2009/08/releases-devices-support-oh-my.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (darkstar62)</author><thr:total>6</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1140104932379868918.post-5828439995299766255</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2009 03:18:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-08-06T20:22:06.468-07:00</atom:updated><title>Moving along...</title><description>So, we've somewhat changed the focus of the project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No longer are we specifically targeting the Wing/Herald.

After a long while, I stumbled across the &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/linwizard/wiki"&gt;Linwizard&lt;/a&gt; project, whose kernel release booted without modification on my phone.  Yay!  Being the hacker that I am, I decided to grab the code to their kernel and see what things I could get it to do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two or three months later, I notice a &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=398830"&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/"&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/index.php"&gt;forum&lt;/a&gt; about porting Google's Android to the Wing.  Thus, the Wing Linux project was started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward about 6 months from that, and we have Android running on our phones, with all kinds of peripheral goodies working for us -- touchscreen, keyboard, buttons, GSM.  All through our own custom modifications of the kernel originally taken from Linwizard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being that we're an open-source project, I'd always had the intention of contributing our changes back to the Linwizard project, which brings me to our topic.  Today marks the completion of the two or three-day process of merging our changes back into their project.  With this merge, both projects benefit -- they benefit by having fixes we made added to their work, allowing the HTC Wizard to more fully function in Linux.  They also have a much easier path to running Android on the Wizard.  We benefit by having access to the very latest changes their project has introduced -- among them, GSM with sound and soon, full audio support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to all this, our patches, combined with their work, are being sent upstream to the main Linux kernel for inclusion in future released kernels.  This means some day it will be possible to pull a kernel off of &lt;a href="http://kernel.org"&gt;kernel.org&lt;/a&gt; and build it for the Wing/Herald, Wizard, etc. instead of having to go scouring the internet trying to find a project working on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, this is a huge win for everyone, and I'd like to thank all that were involved in making this happen.  Without you, we wouldn't be where we are today.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1140104932379868918-9203070834439325920?l=wing-linux.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://wing-linux.blogspot.com/2009/07/giving-back-to-oss-community.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (darkstar62)</author><thr:total>1</thr:total></item><item><guid isPermaLink='false'>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1140104932379868918.post-1233769077183809042</guid><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2009 03:43:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2009-07-25T21:13:28.494-07:00</atom:updated><title>Greetings, from the Depths of Open Source-dom!</title><description>Hello and welcome to our humble blog!  I'd like to take this time to introduce myself.  I am Cory.  Or, as I'm known on the interwebs, darkstar62.  I'm one of the developers on this project of ours, and I'd like to tell you a bit about what's been going on lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've been working like crazy to get our next release out, version 0.4.  It's gonna be pretty sweet -- &lt;a href="http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/"&gt;Angstrom Linux 2007.12&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/"&gt;Android Cupcake 1.5r2&lt;/a&gt;, along with a lot of goodies.  We've recently gotten GSM and GPRS support working, along with bluetooth support in Angstrom.  And, we've got this really cool kernel module that &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/compcache/"&gt;uses compressed main memory as a swap partition.  &lt;/a&gt;Pretty sweet, considering our poor little devices only have 64mb of SDRAM (for those that aren't familiar with it, Android runs best on 128mb of SDRAM).  Cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're also getting some preliminary support for the &lt;a href="http://pdadb.net/index.php?m=specs&amp;amp;id=708&amp;amp;c=htc_p3400_htc_gene_100"&gt;HTC Gene&lt;/a&gt;, another similar &lt;a href="http://focus.ti.com/general/docs/wtbu/wtbuproductcontent.tsp?templateId=6123&amp;amp;navigationId=12000&amp;amp;contentId=4679"&gt;OMAP850&lt;/a&gt;-based smartphone, thanks to the contributions of kshaurya.  (Yes, we're geeks.  It's ok, We Know What We're Doing&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if this stuff interests you, check our our &lt;a href="http://wing-linux.sf.net/"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; -- we've got lots of stuff to play with.  And the best part is, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;no flashing necessary!&lt;/span&gt;  That's right, you don't have to worry about bricking your phone -- we use a Windows Mobile based boot loading app called &lt;a href="http://www.handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/HaRET"&gt;HaRET&lt;/a&gt; to boot into Linux, all installed from an easy-to-use CAB file.  So give it a try, let us know what you think!  Oh, and grab the &lt;a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/wing-linux/wiki/Development"&gt;0.4pre2&lt;/a&gt; release we just put out today!  It's a killer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks go out to UNFORGiVEN512 for setting all this up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I almost forgot...VIDEOS!
