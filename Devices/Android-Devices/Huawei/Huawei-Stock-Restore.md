Restore the stock system to any Huawei phone with this method.

## Download a Stock ROM

Get a stock ROM for your Huawei phone from the official website, or the mirrors.

Try to find a ROM that is closest to your device/operator/country.

### Lists

Huawei periodically removes the ROMs from their website, so if you can't find it there, download them from the mirrors here.

## Restore to Stock

1. If your SDCard is not already formatted to FAT32, do so now. Remember to backup all your files.

3. Extract the `UPDATE.APP` file from the stock ROM above and put it in `dload`.
4. Turn off your phone and make sure the SDCard is in the phone.
