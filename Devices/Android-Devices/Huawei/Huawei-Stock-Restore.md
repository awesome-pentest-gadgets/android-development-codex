If you have any difficult boot issues or if you need to send back your device for repair, download and install your device's stock firmware.

## Download Stock Firmware

[Huawei Android Firmware](http://www.huaweidevice.com/worldwide/downloadCenter.do?method=index&type=software)

Huawei periodically removes ROMs from their website, so if you can't find it there, download them from the mirrors below.

For best results, try to find a ROM that is closest to your device/operator/country.

## Restore to Stock

1. If your SDCard is not already formatted to FAT32, do so now. Remember to backup all your files.
2. Create a folder called `dload` on the root of your SDCard.
3. Extract the `UPDATE.APP` file from the stock ROM above and put it in `dload`.
4. Turn off your phone and make sure the SDCard is in the phone.
5. Hold the {{Key|Power}} + {{Key|Hang Up Button (RED)}} + {{Key|Volume Up}} buttons to enter update mode.
6. Your phone will start updating and reboot. You have now restored to stock!
