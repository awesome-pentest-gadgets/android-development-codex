A cheap, tiny, underclocked phone that gets the job done. Quite common, with a lot of development effort (a rarity on such a little old phone) though apparently not enough to warrant an XDA board.

## Notes

* Android First Generation (528MHz CPU, 256 RAM)
* Guide Shortname: U8150
* Other Names: T-Mobile Comet
* Recovery Key Combination: Power + Volume Up + Green Call Key

## Sections

* [[U8150 Rooting]] - Rooting is a snap with z4root, though more so because of a dearth of updates.
* [[U8150 Recovery]] - Install a recovery to your phone to flash custom ROMs.
* [[U8150 Custom ROMs]] - An actual, definite list of custom ROMs. This deviation from policy is only done because of the lack of a dedicated forum.
* [[U8150 Back to Stock]] - If you ever have major problems, or just want to return to the original state, just flash an official ROM and you're all set.
