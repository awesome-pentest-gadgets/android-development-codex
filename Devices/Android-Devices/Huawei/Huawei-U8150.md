A cheap, tiny, underclocked phone that gets the job done. Not as popular in the West, but it's big in China, Africa, and Italy. Uses plain ol' AOSP Froyo. 

It's quite common as a low end phone throughout the world, with a lot of development effort (a rarity on such a little old phone) though apparently not enough to warrant an XDA board.

* [[U8150 Rooting]] - Rooting is a snap with z4root, though more so because of a dearth of updates.
* [[U8150 Recovery]] - Install a recovery to your phone to flash custom ROMs.
* [[U8150 Custom ROMs]] - An actual, definite list of custom ROMs. This deviation from policy is only done because of the lack of a dedicated forum.
* [[Huawei Stock Restore]] - If you ever have major problems, or just want to return to the original state, just flash an official ROM and you're all set.

### Other Mods

* [[U8150 Splash Screen]] - Customize the OEM splash screen that appears before the Android bootscreen.
