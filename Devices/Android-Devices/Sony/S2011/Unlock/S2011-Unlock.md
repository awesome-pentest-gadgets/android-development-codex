Sony is one of the more supportive manufacturers out there, and provides a very easy bootloader unlock for the good of all of us. It has it's caveats, but the gesture is nice.

This guide is for all xperia devices from 2011 (xperia mini, mini pro, active, ray, live)

## Disclaimer

* We accept no responsibility for any damage done to your phone. You do all this on your own risk.

In addition, unlocked bootloaders have these caveats that locked bootloaders don't have:

* Using Sony's official unlock will **permanently void your warranty**.
* **You will also lose the ability to play DRM music** (from Sony's store), TrackID will also be broken.
* **Stay away from Sony's OTA updates** (Over-the-Air updates), or you will brick your phone. 
* **You won't be able to update phone via pc companion or sony update service anymore.** 

## Unlockability Check

We need to check if the bootloader is unlockable. For that you have to be on the **Sony Stock ROM.**

1. Call `*#*#7378423#*#*` using the phone dialer. This will send you to the service menu.
2. Go to **Service Info/Configuration** and check **Bootloader Status**.
3. If **Rooting Status:Bootloader Unlock Allowed** shows **Yes**, your bootloader is unlockable and you can go on.

## Methods

Choose from one of two methods below to unlock your phone:

* [[Automatic (With `quangnhut123`'s SE Bootloader Unlocking Tool)|S2011 Automatic Unlock]]
* [[Manual (as described on the Sony unlock website)|S2011 Manual Unlock]]
