For some unknown reason, the SGS3 can be easily carrier-unlocked without using any unlock code. Just set this menu option and you're good to go.

This unlock is permanent, and will not void your warranty as we know it.

Note that on non-native carriers, you might only get EDGE or 3G service, limiting the usefulness of the unlock. This is because all carriers use different bands, with only a few overlaps in 2G and 3G.

### Supported Models

Generally, all GSM variants of SGS3 and GN2 will work with this method. It might even work with other Samsung phones, so report in if it does.

* **T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S III**

* **T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy Note II**
* **AT&T Samsung Galaxy Note II SGH-I317**
* **Samsung Galaxy Note II GT-N7105**
* **Samsung Galaxy Note II GT-N7100**

CDMA versions (Verizon, Sprint, MetroPCS) **cannot** be unlocked with this method.

### Prerequisites:

* **SIM Card from another carrier** (use a friend's?)
* **Stock ROM**; Custom ROMs will not work. Flash back to stock before proceeding.

1. Insert the non-native SIM card into the phone and turn it on.
2. It will ask for an unlock code. Just click **Dismiss**.
3. Open your phone app and dial {{Code|*#197328640#}} . That is, **Asterisk Pound One Nine Seven Three Two Eight Six Four Zero Pound**.
4. Select the options: **Main Menu > [1] UMTS > [1] Debug Screen > [8] Phone Control > [6] Network Lock > Options [3]Perso SHA256 OFF**
5. After choosing the last option, wait for at least *30 seconds*.
6. Press the {{Key|Menu}} button and select **Back**. You should now be in the **[6] Network Lock** section.
7. Choose **[4] NW Lock NV Data INITIALLIZ** .
8. Your phone is now permanently unlocked!
  * If that didn't work, restart your phone and repeat the whole process up to step 4. wait 1 minute 30 seconds at step 5. Then reboot and continue.
