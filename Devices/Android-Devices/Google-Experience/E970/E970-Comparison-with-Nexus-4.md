These comparisons are all about hardware, rather than software, since the LG Optimus G can easily be reflashed into a Nexus 4.

### Hardware Benefits

* The LG Optimus G has an SDCard slot, in conjunction with the existing 16GB of onboard memory. This was the killer function for me.
* The slot holding the SDCard and MicroSIM is easy to open with a fingernail. The Nexus 4 requires a special tool to take out the MicroSIM.
* While the two phones have the same processor, the Nexus 4's processor is not properly heatsinked, resulting in chronic overheating and throttled performace. The Optimus G has no such problem whatsoever, and this may explain it's better performance.

* The Optimus G has physical capacitive buttons located on the very bottom of the bezel, which saves screen space that would normally be eaten up by virtual buttons. (However, if you don't like it or would prefer to use PIE, just disable it after rooting.)
* Although this is just a software thing, the screen on the Optimus G looks better; but only because the software is calibrated better. For some reason, the Nexus 4's software has no color calibration of any kind. 
  * For Nexus 4 users, or Optimus G converters, don't fret; Franco's kernel offers color calibration, and Paranoid Android does it automatically with it's Halfbreed colors.

### Hardware Drawbacks

* Transforming the LGOG into a Nexus 4 is a "some assembly required" process, that we ourselves are struggling to understand. Not everything may work as expected.
* Unlike the Nexus 4's classic and comfy curves, the LG Optimus G instead has boxy rectangular corners, which jab into your wrist. Maybe you just have to hold it a certain way, but Google's design is far more comfortable.
* The Nexus 4 has a far prettier, subtle disco ball effect on the back glass. In comparison, the Optimus G's glass is a less flashy, subtle triangle pattern.
* The Optimus G that can use Nexus 4 ROMs is locked to AT&T by default. You'll need to buy an $8 unlock code, or convince AT&T to unlock it for you.

## LG UI Review

The LG UI actually looks pretty cool at first glance, with the smooth animations of the lockscreen and the launcher. LG deserves credits for keeping their phone's UI light and snappy. But all the other apps, themes, and icons just look like a clone of Touchwiz.

There are two features worth a look at, though. However, they really aren't too useful.

* QSlide - (Sadly, this only works when playing videos. And Moboplayer can do the same, so you're not missing out on much. But it's a cool concept for multitasking that Paranoid Android should adopt.) Unlike the awkward and tiny multiwindow of Touchwiz, or the limited HALO of Paranoid Android, LG has finally created a dual-app solution that actually works. You can run two apps at once, and switch between them by using a slider to transparently fade between the two until one is opaque. You can even see both at the same time, with a transparent layer between the two. [But it has to be seen to be believed.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI0RMh6nEe4)
* The Camera - Just like any other manufacturer, LG pours out a lot into the camera. Even though the hardware is the same as the Nexus 4, something in LG's Camera app optimizes the image. However, it's still no match for the powerful cameras on the market today.
* Quick notes - draw notes on any screen. Meh.
