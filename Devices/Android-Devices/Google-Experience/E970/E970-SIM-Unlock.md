Before changing the system ROM, you will want to unlock the SIM, because only the original firmware is able to unlock the phone.

You have two methods for getting the unlock code; getting the original owner to ask AT&T for one, or paying an unlock service to generate one for you.

### Ask AT&T

If you bought the Optimus G from AT&T, or able to ask the original owner, first try to get the unlock code free from AT&T.

(FIXME: Write the process here)

### Buy Unlock Code

If you don't have the ability to get the unlock code from AT&T, 

There are many sites dealing in this business, but [SIM-Unlock.net](http://sim-unlock.net/simlock/LG/Optimus_G/) is the one we will use as an example (Not that I endorse them, but they worked for me). There, unlocks cost $9. After registering, remember to pay using Paypal.

You can buy a code there, and await the unlock code in about an hour. It takes this long because the unlock code is generated using a special algorithm in software, using your IMEI.

1. Go to sim-unlock.net and choose the LG Optimus G from the settings.
2. Press "Unlock LG Optimus G"to start the process.
3. Choose unlock product for your LG ( in some cases only one product is available ).
4. Enter your LG IMEI number and other required information.
5. Press "order code".
6. At the shopping cart, fill all needed information such as name or e-mail.
7. Pay for an unlock code with PayPal to start the calculation.
8. After the estimated average time, you will be emailed all codes and unlock guide to your LG Optimus G .

---

1. Insert a microSIM card for a carrier other than AT&T.
2. The phone will prompt you for a carrier unlock code. Enter the one you got from the site.
3. After your phone reboots, it will be unlocked to use any GSM carrier.
