Now that you've got your shiny new Nexus 4, check here for some common issues that may come up from time to time.

## Not Issues

Don't overreact when you notice these oddities; they're totally benign.

* **Subtle Rattling** - When shaken, the Nexus 4 will give off a subtle rattling noise. This is normal behavior; the new accelerometer is making the noise.

## Known Issues

These issues are common to all Nexus 4 devices.

* **Yellow Screen Tint (NOT Spots)** - Because of bad color calibration, the screen might look a little yellowish. Hopefully a firmware update will fix it, but until then you'll need screen filters or Franco's kernel to fix it. See [[N4 Troubleshooting#Miscolored Screen]] for more info.
* **Overheating During High Performance** - The Nexus 4 is notorious for it's bad heat distribution; whereas LG Optimus G and the HTC Droid DNA use the same CPU and have no issues. It doesn't help that the Nexus 4 comes with Qualcomm's horrid closed-source CPU governor, `mpdecision`. If you want to do anything beyond calling and texting without cooking your battery, it's *essential* to get a custom ROM with a better kernel. See [[N4 Performance]]

## Issues

> I thought it might be helpful to have a running checklist of things you should look at immediately, when you get your new Nexus 4 in the mail. This is based on common problems found during some searches I've done from within XDA and Nexus 4 forums. Please post anything I've missed, and I'll add to this list:
