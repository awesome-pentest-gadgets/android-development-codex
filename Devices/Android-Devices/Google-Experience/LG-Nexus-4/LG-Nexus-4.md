*This guide is an experiment of the Android Development Codex, an independent project to reform the dispatriate guides of XDA-Developers. For more info, see the [[front page.|Android Development Codex]]*

{{Note|This guide, as well as the Nexus 4 itself, is still under development. Please help out by bringing in content, keeping methods up-to-date, and adding screenshots when possible.}}

{{Under Construction}}

The Google/LG Nexus 4 was the hottest device of late 2012, stuffing the most powerful components available in the nicest looking Nexus to date, all backed by the allure of the Google Experience. And somehow, they managed to sell it a starting price of $299 unlocked.

Unsurprisingly, Google's famous launch fiascos marred the first sale, and the device was sold out for weeks afterward, with even the first buyers waiting in limbo. 

The modding community is still budding, but we have chosen it as the pilot device for the Android Development Codex, to help consolidate the guides and tips from XDA Forums into one clear guide.

## Introduction

* [[Ordering a Nexus 4|N4 Ordering]] - The first step in enjoying a Nexus 4 is getting it in your hands. At the moment, this is the most difficult thing you will ever do with this device.
* [[N4 Checklist]] - Once you get your Nexus 4, see this checklist to single out common issues.

## Miscellaneous

* [[N4 Timeline]] - Important events in the Nexus 4's lifetime.
* [[MTP Mount]] - Using Mac or Linux? All Google Nexus devices after the Galaxy Nexus use MTP for file transfer instead of USB Mass Storage. While this offers a few advantages, your system needs to be set up to use this once irrelevant system.
* [[N4 Troubleshooting]] - Lists and fixes for common issues with the Nexus 4.
* [[N4 Sources]] - All the pages that we used to build this guide, and all the people who made it possible.

## Unlock, Recovery, and Root

* [[Nexus Rooting Intro]] - An introduction to rooting the Nexus devices
* [[Nexus Drivers]] - Set up your device to work with ADB.
* [[Nexus Toolkits]] - The easy, one-click root. Great for noobs who want to get it done quickly and easily.
* [[Nexus Manual Method]] - While one-click root/unlock programs exist and are *perfectly safe to use*, take advantage of the great opportunity to understand more by using the manual method; few other devices are as straightforward or forgiving.
* [[Nexus Restore]] - Got any problems, or need to send your device back for repair? Just restore it to stock.

## Custom ROMs and Performance

After rooting, you can elect to stay on Google's stock Android, or try out exciting new features and kernels with better performance.

* [N4 Custom ROMs](http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=1911) - *Ongoing Development* A link to XDA's Android Development Forums, where you can find custom ROMs for your phone.
* [[N4 Performance]] - The N4 might have the best chipset around, but performance is dampened by it's inefficient casing and sub-optimal CPU governor. There are ways of sidestepping the issue.
