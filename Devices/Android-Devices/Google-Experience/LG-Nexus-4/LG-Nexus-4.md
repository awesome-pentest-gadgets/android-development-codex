The Google/LG Nexus 4 was the hottest device of late 2012, stuffing the most powerful parts available in the nicest looking Nexus to date, all backed by the promise of the Google Experience. But the biggest key to the Nexus 4's popularity was it's low starting price of $299 unlocked.

All of these specs led to a mad rush that was compounded by Google's famous launch fiascos, coupled with a lack of transparency on shipping.
