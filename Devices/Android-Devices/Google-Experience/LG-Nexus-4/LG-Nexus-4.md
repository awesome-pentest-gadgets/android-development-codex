The Google/LG Nexus 4 was the hottest device of late 2012, stuffing the most powerful components available in the nicest looking Nexus to date, all backed by the allure of the Google Experience. And somehow, they managed to sell it a starting price of $299 unlocked.

Unsurprisingly, Google's famous launch fiascos marred the first sale, and the device was sold out for weeks afterward, with even the first buyers waiting in limbo.

### Rooting/Unlocking

Here, we unlock and root the Nexus 4 to make deeper mods, install custom ROMs, and gain full control over your phone.

While one-click root/unlock programs exist and are *perfectly safe to use*, we recommend trying out the manual methods. Take advantage of the great opportunity to understand more about the process of rooting; few other devices are as straightforward or forgiving.

* [[N4 Unlocking]] - Just the same easy procedure as any other Nexus.
* [[N4 Rooting]] *Ongoing Development* - We root to gain full control over your phone, use special apps that add useful new features, and enable the installation of custom ROMs.
* [[N4 Custom Recovery]] *Experimental* - Custom Recoveries allow you to install custom ROMs and recover from bad flashes. Reliable custom recoveries have not been released yet, but development is ongoing and will be speed up as developers get their orders in.
* [N4 Custom ROMs](http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=1911) - *Ongoing Development* A link to XDA's Android Development Forums, where you can find custom ROMs for your phone. Currently quite sparse.
