*This guide is an experiment of the Android Development Codex, an independent project to reform the dispatriate guides of XDA-Developers. For more info, see the [[front page.|Android Development Codex]]*

{{Under Construction}}

The Google/LG Nexus 4 was the hottest device of late 2012, stuffing the most powerful components available in the nicest looking Nexus to date, all backed by the allure of the Google Experience. And somehow, they managed to sell it a starting price of $299 unlocked.

Unsurprisingly, Google's famous launch fiascos marred the first sale, and the device was sold out for weeks afterward, with even the first buyers waiting in limbo. 

The modding community is still budding, but we have chosen it as the pilot device for the Android Development Codex, to help consolidate the guides and tips from XDA Forums into one clear guide.
