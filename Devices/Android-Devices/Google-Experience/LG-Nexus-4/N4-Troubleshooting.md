Ever heard the phrase, "you get what you pay for?" Sadly, that's the case with LG, the controversial manufacturer of the Nexus 4.

The good thing is that Google will immediately replace your Nexus 4 at no cost if there are any issues. So make sure to inspect your Nexus 4 when you first get it.

## Ordering a Replacement

You can order a replacement easily from this link. It will send you a replacement phone immediately. You will get a $350 authorization hold, which will be refunded upon receipt of the defective phone.

Make sure to keep the UPS shipping label, the reciept, and the order number from Google Play emails.


Google's warranty for the Nexus 4 lasts a year after purchase. Make sure to utilize it. And no worries about shipping times; Google maintains a special warehouse of replacement Nexus 4 phones.

Also, if you rooted your Nexus 4, don't panic. Just reflash the official ROM and you're good to go.

However, if you bought your Nexus 4 from eBay, you are risking the warranty, so stay in touch with the seller. There is no international warranty, either; you need to go back to the country of origin for support. This is the number one reason why you should avoid eBay scalpers.

## Fixable with Software

### Hovering Effect on Flat Surfaces

One of the most interesting design flaws of the Nexus 4 is the lack of friction on the edges. This gives it a sort of "hovering" effect on flat surfaces, which can prove fatal for your phone if it's near a table edge. Try it yourself; it's been proven many times.

You absolutely must get some kind of impact case for your Nexus 4 if you hope for it to survive. Maybe the official bumper case, maybe a nice TPU case. But you need something, anything to stop it from committing suicide.

### Rattling Sound

* Problem: When I shake the Nexus 4, there is some subtle rattling noise.
* Solution: This is completely normal behavior. There is no issue.

The Nexus 4 uses a new accelerometer with moving parts, which gives off a rattling noise when shaken. It's not a problem at all.

If there is more than just a little subtle rattling, that is cause for concern, but it is very unlikely.

### Miscolored Screen

* Problem: The entire screen seems... off. Yellowed. In color, anyway.
* Solution: The issue is with the software, not the hardware. Use an app to raise the blue color by +5.

Nexus phones are known for their lack of color calibration. No one knows the reason why; but at the very least, you can be safe in the fact that there is no hardware error, and it can be easily fixed through an app.

**Method 1: Without Root**

Use [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netmanslab.sa&hl=en) to bump up the blue color by +5, or whatever feels comfortable.

Note that this is just a color overlay. For security purposes, Android prevents app installation when there is an overlay on, so you'll need to turn the overlay off to press **Install**.


**Method 2: With Root Kernel Tweak**

Use Faux123's kernel with Gamma Correction.


### Insensitive Screen

An issue inherent to all Nexus 4 phones is a lack of sensitivity compared to other smartphones. The first thing you should do is check if the plastic film is still on the screen.

However, some people have reported issues even without the plastic. If so, check if your digitizer is broken at a certain point with this app:

Run your fingers all over the screen. If there is a band of empty space, your digitizer is broken; call for replacement immediately.

Nobody knows whether this is a software or hardware issue, or a part of the design.

The iPhone 5 has a similar issue with touch sensitivity.

### Volume is too low

* Problem: While the Nexus 4 inherits excellent and clean audio drivers from the LG Optimus G, [for some reason the maximum volume is extremely low.](http://www.gsmarena.com/google_nexus_4-review-860p8.php)
* Solution: The only solution as of now is to get root and recovery. The flashable below greatly increases the volume of the sound on the Nexus 4, and also adds some extra audio engines.

## Defects

After getting your Nexus 4, make sure to check for these common issues.

### Dead Pixels

* Test: Open up a purely white image on your screen, and look for any unexpected black spots.
* Solution: If there is more than one, call for a replacement.

Dead pixels are common defects on screens in general.

### Buzzing Headsets

### Yellow Spots

* Problem: Yellow spots appear on some areas of the screen. (Note: A fully yellow screen is a different issue entirely)
* Solution: Wait a few weeks for the spots to go away. If they reappear or worsen, call for a replacement immediately.

Yellow spots are a common issue with smartphones in general, from the iPhone to the HTC One X. They seem to be a result of the glue failing to dry in time when it is out of the factory.
