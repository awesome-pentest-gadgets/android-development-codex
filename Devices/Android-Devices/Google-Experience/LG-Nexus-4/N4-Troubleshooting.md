## Normal Behavior

### Hovering Effect on Flat Surfaces

One of the most interesting design flaws of the Nexus 4 is the lack of friction on the edges. This gives it a sort of "hovering" effect on flat surfaces, which can prove fatal for your phone if it's near a table edge. Try it yourself; it's been proven many times.

You absolutely must get some kind of impact case for your Nexus 4 if you hope for it to survive. Maybe the official bumper case, maybe a nice TPU case. But you need something, anything to stop it from committing suicide.

### Rattling Sound

* Problem: When I shake the Nexus 4, there is some subtle rattling noise.
* Solution: This is completely normal behavior. There is no issue.

The Nexus 4 uses a new accelerometer with moving parts, which gives off a rattling noise when shaken. It's not a problem at all.

If there is more than just a little subtle rattling, that is cause for concern, but it is very unlikely.

### Miscolored Screen

* Problem: The entire screen seems... off. In color, anyway.
* Solution: The issue is with the software, not the hardware. Wait for a software update, or root your phone and install a ROM with decent calibration.

Nexus phones are known for their lack of color calibration. No one knows the reason why; but at the very least, you can be safe in the fact that there is no hardware error.

### Insensitive Screen

An issue inherent to all Nexus 4 phones is a lack of sensitivity compared to other smartphones. The first thing you should do is check if the plastic film is still on the screen.

However, some people have reported issues even without the plastic. Nobody knows whether this is a software or hardware issue, or a part of the design.

The iPhone 5 has a similar issue with touch sensitivity.

## Defects

After getting your Nexus 4, make sure to check for these common issues.

### Dead Pixels

* Test: Open up a purely white image on your screen, and look for any unexpected black spots.
* Solution: If there is more than one, call for a replacement.

Dead pixels are common defects on screens in general.

### Buzzing Headsets

### Yellow Spots

* Problem: Yellow spots appear on some areas of the screen. (Note: A fully yellow screen is a different issue entirely)
* Solution: Wait for the spots to go away. If they reappear or worsen, call for a replacement immediately.

Yellow spots are a common issue with smartphones in general, from the iPhone to the HTC One X.
