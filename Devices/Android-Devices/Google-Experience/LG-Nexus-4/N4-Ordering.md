Ordering the Nexus 4 can be extremely aggravating and difficult. Here are some tips to get through the crowds and nab one for yourself.

## Suggested Tactics

* **Set up Google Wallet before ordering!** The less servers and checkpoints you need to break through, the better.
* **Check the [/r/Nexus4 Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/) or [/r/Android](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/) for news.** These are the largest community dedicated to nabbing an N4, and they will warn you of important tips and tricks.
* **Subscribe to email or GTalk monitors** to see if or when the Nexus 4 is in stock.
* **Set up a script** that will automatically add the Nexus 4 to your cart when it is available.
* **Start your scripts 30 minutes early!** Google notoriously releases devices early, in pursuit of the lulz.

## Wave 2 (12:00PM PST 11/27/12)

During Wave 2, buyers faced a similar mad rush and horrible ordering experience. Google, brought to it's knees by traffic from watcher scripts, began instituting a "pre-order" system in everything but name. Buyers could expect to receive their phones in about 8 weeks.

### You Shall Not Pass: The Proceed Button

However, the pre-order system still brought down the payment servers, and the "proceed" button in the cart did not work. For most buyers, the only solution is to mash the button until the server responds.

Redditor DeathByAssphyxiation tells buyers to ["never refresh, just keep pressing the button."](http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/13w3yg/you_you_are_my_new_worst_enemy/c77ovvw) [Auto-clickers](http://www.reddit.com/r/nexus4/comments/13vvi2/official_nexus_4_round_2_order_thread/c77piyo) are strongly suggested.

Another method is to use {{Key|Tab}} to navigate to the button, and to [keep the {{Key|enter}} button held down.](https://twitter.com/TomDanTheRock/status/273546858289303554)

## Wave 1 (8:00PM PST 11/13/12)

### Cart Busters

When the release date begins to heat up, set up a cart buster script to nab the device just in time, like only a machine can.
