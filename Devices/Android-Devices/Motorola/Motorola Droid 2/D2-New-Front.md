The Motorola Droid 2 was the successor to Verizon's popular Droid smartphone, which made Android what it is today with it's ubiquity, business-ready fashion sense, and hackability.

But due to Verizon's demands, the new Droid 2 was shipped with an encrypted bootloader that did everything to prevent a developer community from ever springing up again.

The result for you? A dearth of custom ROMs, improvements, and updates, difficult rooting methods, and danger at every turn. The Droid 2 and Droid X are the most developer-unfriendly devices the world has ever seen, even compared to other Motorola smartphones. Lube up; it's going to be a painful journey.
