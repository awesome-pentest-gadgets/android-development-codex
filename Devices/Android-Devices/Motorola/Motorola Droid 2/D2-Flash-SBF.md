## Flashing an SBF 

Refer to this whenever the guide tells you to "install an SBF", which is Motorola's way of flashing ROMs.

The Linux methods are *strongly recommended*. Windows methods have not always been successful, and that could result in critical errors. But don't worry; there are easy-to-use Linux liveCDs that are built just for this purpose.

### Linux LiveCD

This is perhaps the simplest, easiest, and safest way to flash SBFs. Just burn this Linux image to a CD, and run it on your computer. 

### Mac OS X and Linux (sbf_flash)

If you already have Linux or Mac installed, you can just use the `sbf_flash` program.

### Windows (RSDLite)

RSDLite depends on Windows, which can take a bit of work to get the drivers working
