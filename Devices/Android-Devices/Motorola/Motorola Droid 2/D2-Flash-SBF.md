Refer to this whenever the guide tells you to "install an SBF". This is Motorola's way of flashing ROMs.

The Mac/Linux methods are *strongly recommended*. RSDLite on Windows has been buggy and finicky, which can result in critical errors. But don't worry; we've got easy-to-use LiveCDs for you Windows lovers.

### Linux LiveCD

This is perhaps the simplest, easiest, and safest way to flash SBFs. Just burn this Linux image to a CD, and run it on your computer. 

1. Download the LiveCD from [here]().
2. [[Burn the downloaded image to a disc|LiveCD]], or a [[USB Drive|LiveUSB]].
3. Set your computer to boot from CD or USB, and insert your live media into your computer.
4. Follow the instructions that the Linux LiveCD gives you.

### Mac OS X and Linux (sbf_flash)

If you already have Linux or Mac installed, you can just use the [`sbf_flash` program](http://blog.opticaldelusion.org/2011/02/sbfflash-updates.html).

{Warning|If you are flashing an official ROM, please do not flash any older versions! Downgrading will brick your phone. To be safe, only use [this SBF ROM](https://sites.google.com/site/motosbf/droid-2-sbf-files)}

1. Download the SBF file that you need.
2. [Download the `sbf_flash` program.](http://dl.opticaldelusion.org/sbf_flash)
3. Move your chosen SBF file to the same folder as the `sbf_flash` program.
4. 

### Windows (RSDLite)

{{Warning|RSDLite is known to be finicky, problematic and error ridden. This could be fatal for your phone. If at all possible, use the above methods!}}

RSDLite depends on Windows, which can take a bit of work to get the drivers working
