## AT&T 2.20 X-Factor

In build 2.20: full S-ON is now in effect, which NAND-locks the storage. In other words, you need to unlock the bootloader to gain permanent root.

XDA User Djrbliss built an exploit that gains temporary root access by leveraging two vulnerabilities and uses these newly gained root privileges to overwrite the CID ("superCID"), so that it's possible to unlock the bootloader via HTC's website.
