{{Note|This is the S4 variant of the HTC One X. If your One X comes from outside Canada and the US, use [[the international guides.|HTC One X]]}}

This variant is sold by AT&T and Rogers, and was codenamed HTC Evita. It also encompasses the Telstra One XL. 

This variant is perhaps one of the more difficult roots, due to the hoops that you'll have to jump through as a result of carrier shenanigans. There are a few toolkits to helpcan be unlocked with  you on your way, though.

## Specs

* CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Dual-Core
* Short Name: Evita, OneXS4

## AT&T Root/Unlock/Recovery

Follow these guides in order if you have an AT&T HTC One X.

{{Warning|The current root method (for 2.20) uses HTCDev, **which permanently wipes all data and voids your warranty.** There is no known method of reliably backing up app data, since TitaniumBackup requires root to work and the secret 4.0 backup is broken on HTC Sense.}}

* [[Evita Rooting]] - AT&T's carrier shenanigans mean that every update attempts to patch over the root method. As a result, root methods differ from version to version.
* [[Evita Recovery]] - TWRP is strongly recommended, as CWM is not officially supported. DON'T USE ROM MANAGER. It may brick your device, because it uses the international HTC One X CWM.
* [[Evita Custom ROMs]] - Since the HTC One X Evita does not have a safe method of gaining S-OFF, you will have to flash `boot.img` every time you want to install a new ROM.

* [[Evita S-OFF]] (Work in Progress) - Devs are cooking up methods of gaining S-OFF on, but nothing safe has been made yet. 
  * When HTCDev unlock is used, the phone remains S-ON, which prevents recoveries from writing to the boot partition. This requires an inconvenient kernel reflash from a computer whenever a new custom ROM is installed.

### Rogers Root/Unlock/Recovery

(Needs work, and I don't have a Rogers version)

* [[Evita Unlock]] - The Rogers One X is an official HTCDev device. You can spoof the AT&T One X into unlocking using SuperCID.]
