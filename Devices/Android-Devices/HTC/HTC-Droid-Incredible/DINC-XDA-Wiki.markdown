:* It blazes across the digital universe. It snaps stunning 8-megapixel photos. It zips them instantly to all of your 8,000 friends. With such attention to detail on the inside and out, the name of this phone pretty much says it all.
:* Detailed focus. With eye-popping 8-megapixel resolution and built-in editing, it’s not a camera phone. It’s an amazing camera that happens to be an amazing phone. 
:* Built for speed.. HTC designers found inspiration for the Droid Incredible in a jet-black Italian sports car. With a blazing-fast 1GHz Snapdragon™ processor, it seems our hardware engineers did, too.
