These are the files needed to unlock the [[HTC Droid Incredible]].

You will need to get the proper drivers to interface with your phone. You can choose either to install HTCSync for the drivers, or better yet, use the [modified HTC drivers from revolutionary](http://downloads.unrevoked.com/HTCDriver3.0.0.007.exe). Follow the instructions there to install them.

Then download these two files and move them to the folder where `adb` is installed.
