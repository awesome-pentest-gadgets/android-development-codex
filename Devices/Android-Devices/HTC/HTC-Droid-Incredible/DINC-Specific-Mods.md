For the most part, once you install a custom ROM you are pretty much done, the builder has usually done the big system modifications for you. Most Gingerbread and Sense 3 ROMs are already perfect.

For ICS and JB ROMs, you might want to add a few replacement apps to increase speed and add more features. Get these from the Play Store:

* **Nova Launcher** - The better, faster launcher for Android. Feature-filled and lightning fast, even on the slower phones. The launcher is the face of Android and most of the big, visible speed issues start here, so it's important to have something that works nicely.
* **Quickpic** - The better image viewer for Android. Way better than the slow and clunky default Gallery.
* **MX Video Player** - This is Android's equivalent of VLC. Plays anything you can throw at it.

Next, you might want to flash the [Adrenaline Injector](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1236779) with your recovery to add scripts to speed things up, reduce battery usage, and give a smoother experience. Finally, the [Ext4 4 ALL](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1315372) mod will update your filesystem on the phone to Linux's best and fastest.

This only scratches the surface of what you can do with your phone. For more info, see the **[[Android Modifications]]** page.
