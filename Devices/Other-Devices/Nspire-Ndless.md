# Ndless

## Installing Ndless

### If using OS 3.2

Unfortunately, Ndless does not work on OS 3.2. 

On the other hand, we can just downgrade to OS 3.1 to get Ndless. TI did not restrict downgrades to 3.1 for some unknown reason; we think it was an escape route in case of bugs.


### Install Ndless 3.1
