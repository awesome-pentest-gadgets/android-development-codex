The TI-Nspire is a graphing calculator heavily updated for a world in the smartphone age. For one, it's not just another 30-year old Z80 design; the CX models sport a powerful 150MHz ARM processor, equal to the Pocket PCs of old.

However, it's true power is hidden behind a wave of security controls and some ineffectual BASIC and Lua scripts. This guide is about installing Ndless and trying out a wave of emulators, programs, scripts, all kinds of things to get you through Calculus class without sleeping.

This guide works with both the original TI-Nspire and the improved CX version. Just note that the CX calcs will be more practical for CPU intensive or color apps like emulators.

### Ndless

{{Note|Your calculator must be at firmware version 3.1 or less to install Ndless 3.1. No method has been discovered to install ndless on 3.2.}}

* [[Nspire Ndless]] - Ndless enables allows custom apps to be run on the TI-Nspire using traditional programming languages, like any decent computer.
* [[Nspire Ndless SDK]] - Ndless also provides a nice SDK for developers to work in, packing a nice emulator to boot.
* [[Nspire Linux]] - A small build of embedded ARM Linux created with Buildroot. Works quite nicely, though apps have to be cross-compiled with buildroot.
