What is a smartphone without overpriced accessories? Some of them are quite useful though, so take a look.

## Extra Batteries and External Battery Charger

Smartphones drain battery life with in the matter of a few days at best, so getting an extra battery pack and an external charger will allow you to just switch them out when it's time is up.

OEM HTC HD2 batteries are actually pretty cheap, around $10 or so on Amazon.

## Cases 

I, for one, hate those plastic phone covers. But you can't doubt their effectiveness in keeping scratches, dings, and cracks away from your treasured HD2. Silicon cases are pretty good for the money, but they get cracks themselves and collect dust. For hard cases, take the trouble to find a high quality one.

The slip cover that HTC provides out of the box is pretty nice. However, it can suck to have to take your phone out all the time, so they sell another leather flip case that is pretty good if you can find it. Otterbox is the best for hard cases.

## Screen Protectors

I don't like screen protectors at all, and the HD2's Gorilla Glass does a pretty good job of resisting pretty much anything other than sand. Still, if you're one to put your keys with your phone, it's a good idea to use protection.
