While the word "Microsoft Windows" has never given an impression of great design, Windows Phone 7 breaks the mold with it's appealing UI and small, but beautiful library of Metro apps. It runs very well on the good ol' HD2, and if you've gotten used to mess of Windows Mobile 6, Windows Phone 7 will blow you away.

## Installation

Windows Phone 7 can only be installed to the phone memory using MAGLDR.

## Implementation

The HTC HD2 was not given an update to Windows Phone 7 by Microsoft due to "strict button requirements". HTC simply repurposed the HD2's hardware to run WP7, and the result was the HTC HD7. Drivers pulled from the HD7 are the key to running WP7 on the HD2.

One flaw was that multitouch did not work, so DFT's Cotulla built an all new driver to support it.

Windows Phone 7 runs very nicely on the HD2, with no major lag or crippling issues.

## MAGLDR NAND WP7

The implementation of WP7 on MAGLDR is unknown, since MAGLDR is closed source.

Installing WP7 is a matter of using a ROM flasher from the computer.
