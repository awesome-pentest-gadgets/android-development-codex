[NativeSD](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1869673) is an exciting new project that fully utilizes the greater space and faster speeds of the microSD cards. Rather than using a chroot image on dated FAT, you will need create a purpose-built ext4 partition on the card.

More info can be found in the link, the project is a bit dynamic, but we do want to clear up a method. Will write stuff here soon...

The ROMs that you need are tagged "NativeSD". These can be found on both the [NAND](http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=928) and [SD](http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=735) development boards.
