This is the older method for getting Android on SDCards. It's as simple as moving a folder with a file manager, but Android will be a bit slower than the new [[NativeSD|HD2 Android NativeSD]] method.

1. Find an SD ROM you want to install from the [XDA-Developers SD Development Board](http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=735). Make sure that it is not a NativeSD ROM.
2. Extract the downloaded zip file and place the folder on the SDCard.

## If you're using MAGLDR

3. Boot your HD2 to MAGLDR, select `Services`, Go to `Boot Settings`, then `AD SD`, and then choose the folder your ROM is in.

## If you're using cLK

(needs work)
