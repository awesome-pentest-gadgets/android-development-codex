If for any reason you need to go back to stock (like for servicing or using an unlock code), just follow these steps. Note that you will have to install everything back again, just like a new HD2.

Download an [official Windows Mobile Rom from here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=577717). The newest ROM edition is `2.13`, so look for the `Leo 2.13` folder and find your model. *Double check that you have the right ROM for the right model.*

1. Back up your sd card and format it.

2. Extract the file `leoimg.nbh` from the official rom you previously downloaded.(This can be done with a program like 7zip)

3. Copy `leoimg.nbh` onto the root of your sd card. Only copy this file-- No OTHERS!

4. Press and hold *volume down + end* keys

5. Follow the onscreen steps. These steps will install Windows Mobile 6.5

6. Reboot your phone. Your phone wil boot into Windows Mobile 6.5 and HSPL is uninstalled.
