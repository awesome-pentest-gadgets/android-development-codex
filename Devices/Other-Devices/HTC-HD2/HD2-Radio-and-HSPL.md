To install custom ROMs to your HD2, you will need to install a special HSPL to your HD2 that will allow you to do so. Installing an engineering HSPL is the equivalent of rooting on Android. 

To really do anything useful, you need to install a radio v. 2.08.50 or later. These control the cell phone radio chip, which can sometimes be impediments.

### CotullaHSPL

This is the standard engineering HSPL that most people use, developed by Cotulla, the creator of MAGLDR.

1. Power off your phone.

2. Hold the *Volume Down* Button and press the End (red) key once. Continue holding until a multi colored screen appears.

3. Plug in your USB cord to your phone. At the bottom of your Phone it should say SERIAL until your USB is connected. Once USB is connected it should say USB at the bottom.

4. Launch the previously downloaded **HD2 Toolkit**.

5. Click **Install HSPL** at the bottom right hand of the screen. Make sure to install `HSPL 2.08` . Just follow the steps, and make sure your device meets the requirements before proceeding. (50% battery, anti-virus disabled, etc)

*Note* After HSPL is flashed, hold down volume down button as soon as the phone reboots. Your phone will enter the bootloader screen.
