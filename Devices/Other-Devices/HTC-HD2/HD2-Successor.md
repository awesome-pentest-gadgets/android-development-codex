As many of you know quite well, the HD2 has no parallel in ability and range of operating systems. But it's quickly showing it's age, and life would be great if some kind of successor could appear.

## WP7 Phones

Windows Phone 7 phones are in a similar predicament to the HD2; they were based on WinCE, made by Microsoft, and abandoned with the advent of WP8.

These specific things must be done in order for Linux and Android to be ported to WP7 devices.

* **Bring back HARET for WP7.** Another way to get Android on WP7 is through the classic HARET, which loads a Linux kernel in Windows CE. This is actually in development, but they really need some assistance to make it possible.
* **Bring MAGLDR to other phones.** This bootloader is the ultimate source of the HD2's power, and it would be groundbreaking to port it to other phones, especially Windows Phone 7 devices.

## Existing Phones Similar to HD2

These phones already have capabilities like the HD2, running multiple operating systems.

* **HP Touchpad:** A firesale powerhouse running WebOS, Android, and the best Linux OSes in town. A big community lurks on it too.
* **Nokia N9:** This Meego classic is a good match for the HD2, with Android, Meego, Mer, and full Linux support. But the hardware on it is about the same as the HD2, and the community is much smaller and more lethargic.
* **Nokia N900:** A phone that somehow makes Linux fun and easy to use with Maemo, a solid keyboard, and it's Hildon interface. It's a phone that you'll never get tired of.

## Candidate Phones

Candidate phones are in a similar situation to the HD2 and are ripe for development.

* **Jolla Phones:** Not content with Nokia's 
* **All Windows Phone 7 devices:** With the advent of WP8, it seems like these have become obsolete in the same way the HD2 was with WM6. Many of these use the same hardware as Android, so we could bring drivers over just like we did for WP7 on the HD2. This is a great opportunity to bring Android support over, and we already have a precedent with the Samsung Omnia 7.
* **Nexus devices:** Google Nexus devices are the most open and the best suited for future development. Most of them have all component drivers and software open-source, making them the best bet for any dev work.
