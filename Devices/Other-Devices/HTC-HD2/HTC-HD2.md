The HTC HD2 is truly the dream phone of the mobile world, and a testament to the golden age of HTC. Upon it's release in late 2009, it had a huge screen of unprecedented size (for it's time), half a gig of memory, and the most powerful processor of it's time. What's there not to like?

There was only one crippling flaw; it was stuck on the dated and later abandoned Windows Mobile 6.5, in a time where Windows Phone 7 was in the cards, iPhone was king and Android was quickly catching up.

The story would have ended there, but as the most powerful phone in the market and firesales looming, developers on XDA quickly looked for ways to load different mobile operating systems to this superphone. 

Eventually, the developers managed to stuff not just each of the newest versions of Android, but also Windows Phone 7, and even entire Linux operating systems. Each year, the phone just kept getting better and better, becoming the stuff of developer legend.

As of this writing, even the venerable HD2 is beginning to feel a bit dated, but it's safe to say that it will still be loved for quite a while longer. 

## The benefits of modding the HD2

If your HD2 is currently on stock Windows Mobile 6.5, it's well worth taking the jump to a whole new world and a whole new phone experience. Let's look at the many benefits. 

No phone to date has ever matched the versatility of the HD2, and unfortunately, it does not seem like there will be anything like it in the future.

* Ability to use a multitude of modern, stable phone OSes
  * Android (currently up to 4.1 Jelly Bean as of 9/28/12)
  * Windows Phone 7 (up to 7.8 as of 9/28/12)
  * Linux (Fully featured, no-holds-barred Debian Linux ARM)
  * Quite a few more (and some others under research, like Tizen and Firefox OS)
* Ability to dual-boot Android from SDCard and Windows Phone 7 on phone memory with MAGLDR
* cLK can make the HD2 work like an ordinary Android device with adb and fastboot

Pretty amazing for a 3 year old phone. Not even the greatest of Google's Nexus devices can stand up to the HD2's longevity and versatility.
