There are a ton of flashing utilities and methods for installing things onto the HD2, and it can get to be a unwarranted, dangerous, and confusing mess. 

Instead, we'll be using bzdeme's (based on [ksubedi's](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1090783) ) [HD2 Toolkit](http://d-h.st/qgm) as our bread and butter. This program pretty much does everything short of the new NativeSD method, so download it and [install the drivers](http://d-h.st/jIk) before proceeding.

Sadly, all of these flashers only work with Windows (due to the nature of how HSPL works), so if you don't have it, get Windows or fire up [Virtualbox with USB passthrough](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
