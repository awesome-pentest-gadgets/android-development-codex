## Installing Linux to HD2

Running full-blown Linux works similarly to the old Android SDCard method; you just copy a folder to the card and set MAGLDR to use that directory.

1. Find an Linux ROM you want to install from the [XDA-Developers Linux/Ubuntu Development Board](http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=983). 
* Notice that this board is quite convoluted and outdated, so if you are in doubt, the [Debian E17](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1729130) and the [Ubuntu InDev](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1975081) is the best around.

2. Extract the downloaded zip file and place the folder on the SDCard.

## If you're using MAGLDR

3. Boot your HD2 to MAGLDR, select `Services`, Go to `Boot Settings`, then `AD SD`, and then choose the folder your ROM is in.
