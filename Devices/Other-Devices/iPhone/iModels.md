## Currently on sale

* Latest iOS version: 6.1.3
* Latest Jailbreak: For iOS 6.1.2

When a model is no longer on sale, Apple will usually end iOS updates for that model. Once this happens, you will be forced to buy a new iPhone to use new, or updated apps, which means 80% of apps listed on the store will not work.

Additionally, Apple restricts new iOS features to new iPhones, in an attempt to egg on users to buy the more expensive models.

## ARMv6

iPhones with ARMv6 processors are no longer supported by Apple. As such, it is not possible to run iOS 4.3 or higher on these models through any means; their processors are incompatible and have been abandoned by Apple. Since new apps are compiled for ARMv7 and higher, there is no way to run apps newer than 4.3 without recompiling the source code. (ironically, Android Gingerbread might be a better option!)

### iDroid Gingerbread 2.3

* Models: 2G, 3G, iTouch 1G

Since Apple has abandoned ARMv6 processors, the irony is that Android might be a better replacement. iDroid only works on the models stated above, (though an iTouch 2G port was attempted).

1. Ensure that your iPhone is jailbroken before proceeding.
1. Open Cydia

#### Install Whited00r

* You will lose the ability to use the App Store from the iPhone. (However, 90% of the apps on there don't work anyway, so there's no loss.)

Whited00r is a custom firmware that attempts to bring the best features and style of the newest iOSes to abandoned ARMv6 iPhones. It is optimized for speed and will keep your old iPhone going for the near future.

Whited00r, however, does NOT allow users to install apps that require iOS and over, as they are physically incompatible with ARMv6.
