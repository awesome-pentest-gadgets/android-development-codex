# PSP Signing

PSP EBOOT signing is the most significant development in PSP homebrew to date. As a result, homebrew now works on official PSP firmwares without the need for any modification on the PSP.

It effectively defeats all of Sony's built in code protections, and is pretty much impossible for them to patch over (as doing so would prevent actual PSP games from running). It marks a magnificent victory (but also closure) to the glorious successes of the PSP Homebrew scene.

The PSP root keys were captured as part of Geohot's momentous discovery of a method to obtain the the root keys of the once-uncrackable PS3. It caused a huge legal war by Sony against the modding scene as they rushed to censor the results.
