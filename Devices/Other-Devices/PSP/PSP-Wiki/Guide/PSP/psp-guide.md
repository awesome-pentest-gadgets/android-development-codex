PSP Homebrew has been part of the device ever since the first system came out for sale. At the time, it was the most powerful handheld gaming system on the market; so powerful, it was more of a computer than any scrappy game boy. More than gaming, it was a multimedia system for movies and music. At $250 apiece, it was a steal for what on the device... literally.

A large group of homebrew hackers worked on the PSP, many with colorful backgrounds, and all highly talented. Update after update, with Sony playing a cat and mouse game to patch exploits, they managed to outwit and surpass a massive company to give end-users true freedom on the device. 

The work we present here in this guide is the legacy of their hard work, a testament to their skill. It has never been well recorded or archived, and we seek to compile their efforts before it is lost to the sands of time (or in this case, /dev/null).

## Homebrew Programs

The exploits and custom firmware are only half the story. The real meat is in the homebrew that the community made for the PSP, and of course the emulators and UMD rippers. 

## Devices

### PSP-1000

This was the first version of the PSP sold, and it is the most ripe for development.
