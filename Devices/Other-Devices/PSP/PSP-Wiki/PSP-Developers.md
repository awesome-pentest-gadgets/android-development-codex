Takka's famous unofficial Japanese version of gPSP, which has a greater amount of features. 

Unfortunately, he does not credit Exophase and goes his merry way violating the attribution clause of the GPL. Otherwise, he does release source code (now lost...) and makes a pretty good program. 

Apparently takka himself quit after 2011, disowning gPSP-kai after 2011 and apologizing for the issues he caused. No reason was given.

* UO gPSP-kai and gPSP-J - Unofficial versions of gPSP, which have been controversial since their inception. At least the source code is made available.

### gPSP

Effort should be made to finally bring together Takka's and Exophase's code into one unified gPSP, which can then be pushed downstream.
