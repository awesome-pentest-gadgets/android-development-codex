An updated version of the PSP Phat. This version is 33% lighter and 19% slimmer than the PSP 1000. The screen was made a little brighter and the internal memory was doubled to shorten the loading times. Also the battery capacity was lowered by 1/3th, but thanks to new Power saving modes, the run time stays the same. A new video-Out port was added to the side.

An updated version of the PSP 2000. Main changes are the brighter screen, addition of a microphone and new UMD-slot design.
