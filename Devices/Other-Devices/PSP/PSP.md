The PSP Homebrew community was one of the most dynamic and successful modding initiatives in the history of consumer electronics. It went from a small operation to bring out the most of the first affordable mobile computing device, and managed to rescue exploit after exploit from the jaws of defeat.

Yet now, their achievements are stuck in obscurity, disappearing under the curses of code and link rot. We need to save, restore, and liquidate what we can salvage from the ruins of the forums and the bottomless depths of the QJ archives.

## What needs to be done

### Homebrew

* Create a list of great homebrew and find source code, save it on an Liquidation Committee github
* Compile the history of homebrew
* Create an intro to homebrew for new users.
* Find guide for popsloader on versions above 5.xx

### Custom Firmware

* Port 6.60 PRO-C to PSP GO (if not already)
* Run through methods of installing 6.60 PRO, compatibility
* Find guides and history for old firmwares

### Exploits

* Make a full Pandora's battery guide
* Make a full history of exploits on the PSP

### Liquidation Committee

* Find an exploit to fully install CFW on newer motherboard PSP-3000s (just for convenience)
  * Find a way to automatically run CFW installer
* Archive the very best homebrew and source code somewhere safe, like the Internet Archive.
* Find all the old PSP devs, find out history
* Bring back TN-Settings to new CFW

### Best MicroSD to Memory Stick Duo

Memory Stick Duos are getting rare and expensive, so having a microSD card adapter is very handy. In fact, some adapters have a RAID setup, so you can plug in two cards to work as one!

If you want to swap cards a lot, use the single slot; it's more stable. If you are using two cards, they need to be formatted to work. Once that is done, don't ever remove them from their slots. Modern PSP Hardware is said to support up to 64GBs, though people have reported success with higher capacities.

While these adapters are acceptable for games and media, please keep at least a 128MB memory stick duo handy for CFW updates and any system sensitive stuff; crazy stuff can happen.
