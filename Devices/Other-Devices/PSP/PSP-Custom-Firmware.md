Once, custom firmwares were the essential endpoint to run homebrew in a difficult journey from exploit to exploit. But now that homebrew works on any PSP, they're easy to install.

Custom firmwares offer these extra features:

* **Runs Signed and Legacy Homebrew** Support for older, unsigned homebrew, in both user and kernel mode, as well as modern signed homebrew.
* **Plugin Mode** - Extend the abilities of your PSP with CFW Plugins.
* **ISO/CSO Game Playback/Dump** - Migrate your aging UMD game library to storage; almost essential, as the discs are quickly breaking down.
* **PSX Emulator Unlock** - Now you can use Sony's secret PSX emulator. Though it's never been perfect.
* And much, much more...

==Current==

All PSPs at any firmware version are now compatible with 6.60 PRO. However, some of the newer ones require a few workarounds to work well.

===6.60===

The last generation of a long history of PSP Custom Firmware. This one picks up where GEN left off with an update to the last Official Firmware 6.60 and an signed installer that works on any PSP model or firmware.

* [[6.60 PRO]] - The PRO series of custom firmwares are the only open-source CFWs available, and are as such the best supported.
** [http://code.google.com/p/procfw/ 6.60 PRO Google Code Project]
* [[6.60 ME]] - A closed source CFW for HEN-based PSPs. Offers a few different and interesting features.

===Official Firmware===

Of course, we will need to delve into Sony's good ol' official firmware. Listed here are the most important ones; the rest can be found in the last link.

* 6.60 OFW

* [[PSP Official Firmware]] - This is a list of all the Official Firmware, and mirrors.

==Archives==

Note: These custom firmwares are obsolete and are only kept here for archival purposes. If you aren't a historian, you don't need them.
