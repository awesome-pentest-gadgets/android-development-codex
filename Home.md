The Android Development Codex is a community-built, comprehensive guidebook to all aspects of Android modding, customized for the phones that make it up. 

It aims to reform the XDA Wiki and consolidate all the information from the forums into one single, easy to read, and up-to-date guide for customized to every Android device. 

Key to this guide is the heavy use of templates to reduce redundancy, device specific guides for the dirty work of rooting, unlocking, and further development, and general guides for modding Android itself.

This is a community-created analog to the Official XDA Developers Book, but extended to all devices.

## Why make a monolithic guide?

Unfortunately, as a result of XDA's messy evolution, there are a confusing mess of tutorials, new and outdated all over the forums. The status quo can be unclear at the least and cause many a brick at the worst. The developers of XDA have constantly been battered by noobs who don't know what they're doing. Why not show them how, with a nice, clear, organized guide? As such I have made one monolithic guidebook to better educate newcomers and keep up with new developments.

Nearly all the content in this guide is a consolidation and rewrite of the groundbreaking work of others in the XDA community. I have attempted to find all the people whose contents and guides are a part of this compilation, with the credits and source links in the below guides. However, if you feel that your name and guide is not in the credits, contact us and we'll put you in.
