After getting a Nexus 4, my brother needed a more powerful smartphone, so I decided to pass it down to him, and shop for a new one. $300 unlocked was my maximum price, so that ruled out pretty much all the phones I wanted (SGS4 GPE, HTC One GPE, Sony Xperia Z).

I was about to buy another Nexus 4, but I discovered that the AT&T LG Optimus G E970 had exactly the same hardware, but added an SDCard slot and LTE support. It could even be reflashed to accept Nexus 4 ROMs. So, I bought one in great condition for only $250, and a SIM unlock cost $10.

In this guide, you too can turn an LGOG into a Nexus 4 with LTE and an SDCard slot.

* [[E970 Comparison with Nexus 4]] - Why get an LGOG E970 instead of a Nexus 4? Well, there's a lot of good reasons.
* [[E970 SIM Unlock]] - You will need to be on the stock ROM to unlock your LG Optimus G, so do that first.
* [[E970 FreeGee]] - The FreeGee app roots and installs custom recovery to your LGOG in a full package. (oddly, there is no known manual rooting method...)
* [[E970 Porting Nexus 4 ROMs]] - The best way to run Nexus 4 Custom ROMs (if the more labor intensive method) is to port them yourself.
* [[E970 Nexus 4 Conversion]] - Alternatively, you can install a Nexus 4 partition scheme onto your LGOG, effectively transforming it into a Nexus 4. This allows you to receive Google's OTA updates, and removes one step to installing Nexus 4 ROMs.
