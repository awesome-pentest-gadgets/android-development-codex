Since downgrading to Froyo also downgrades the HBoot and the Radio, you will want to flash the new version back in for more features and stability.

== 4.08.605.15 radio and 1.07 hboot: ==

Download both files below and flash them both. One is the hboot, one is the radio.

== Flashing the files ==

{{Note|The bootloader may still be in its previous state when you re-flash it (i.e.,if it was unlocked,it will still be). If for some reason, you find it to be locked, you can use your original <tt>unlock-code.bin</tt> to re-unlock it, if you wish.}}

{{Warning|Make sure to double check the md5s, as a bad hboot or radio flash can and will leave your device unworking and unrecoverable. Also, your battery should be more than 50% charged before proceeding.}}

Boot your phone to {{Ic|fastboot}} mode (see Things to Know), and run the commands below:

    fastboot devices
    fastboot erase cache
    fastboot oem rebootRUU
    fastboot flash zip your-zipfile-name-here.zip
    fastboot reboot-bootloader
    fastboot reboot

Repeat this process for the other zip file. Once you've finished that, you're now ready to get some custom ROMs.
