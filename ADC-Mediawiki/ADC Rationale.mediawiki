Currently, the Android modding scene depends heavily on forums as their bread and butter. While forums may be great for fast-paced development, their disjointed, massive threads are horrible for any kind of useful documentation. The results are:

* '''Outdated and dispatriate guides'''
* '''Disunited guidemakers and developers'''
* '''General confusion''', leading to needless bricking
* '''Angry users that create bitter developers'''
* '''"Obvious" troubleshooting tips hidden under a mountain of 500 posts'''
* '''No clear liquidation plan, leading to link rot and loss of hard work in several years''' (see XDA's Windows Mobile 6 forums)

By uniting guidemakers into a single guide, we hope to give end-users great guides, and keep both end-users and developers happy, for once in our history.
