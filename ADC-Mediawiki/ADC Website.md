## Mission

I am creating the Android Development Codex, a wiki that aims to unite the confused mess of guides and guidemakers in the Android Community into a single, up-to-date, and clear tutorial.

This guide is already shaping up pretty well, and is set to revolutionize the Android Modding community.

The current implementation is stored here:

## Extensions

These extensions are a must have, and are the highest priority.

* ParserFunctions Extension - http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ParserFunctions
* ConfirmEdit - http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ConfirmEdit

It would be cool if this theme was added:

If you can, I would love to have these extensions in place:

* EmbedPDF Extension - http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:EmbedPDF
* VideoPlayer - http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:VideoPlayer

Sooner or later I might try out Semantic Mediawiki, so please look into it, but no hard feelings if not.

* Semantic Mediawiki - http://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/

Thanks for your assistance.
