## Guidelines

When creating a guide to be used in the Android Development Codex, please follow these guidelines:

* **List all sources and give all credit where it is due.** - Cite your methods, tools, and sources, if only to add some legitimacy. The developers on XDA worked hard to make these tools and guides. The least you could do is credit them for their work. That said;
* **Don't link to a site or the forum for methods; Move everything to the wiki and give sources.** - 
* **Ensure that all needed files are in a safe place with multiple mirrors.** - Link rot happens, and we have to be prepared.
* **Always include a manual method** for rooting/unlocking/recovery in addition to an easy, one-click method (if any). This ensures that there is something to go back to 
* **Don't create redundant material.** Link to a similar page *from this guidebook* and add stuff there, or suck in a template page.
* Define all terms used in a [[Glossary]] prefacing the guide. Try to use and adapt the templates that already exist to the needs of the guide.

## Basic Device Guide Template

While this template is not set in stone, try not to deviate from it too far..

* **Specifications** - The tech specs at the right displaying all the gritty details of the device.
* **Introduction** - Give a brief summary of what this device is, how the modding community on it evolved, something that makes it special.
* **Glossary** - Stitch together some Glossary Templates so that newbies know what we are talking about.
* **Requirements** - All the files needed and steps that need to be done before proceeding.

----

* **Rooting** - Methods of gaining superuser privileges. Make sure to include the manual method.
* **Unlocking the Bootloader (if any)** 
* **Installing a Recovery Image**
* **Custom ROM Notes** - Notes on what Android versions are available, which ROMs are good, whatnot.
* **Device Specific Modifications** - Mods that specific to this device.
* **Credits and Sources** - Give due credit to developers and record sources for information and guides.
