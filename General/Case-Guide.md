Unfortunately, glass screens on smartphones have been a necessary evil, and even the strongest Gorilla Glass can't resist a drop at just the right angle. 

## The Best Cases

If you're on a tight budget, The **S-Wave TPU** cases give the most bang for your buck, combining the shock resistance of silicone with the solid feel of hard plastic. They are incredibly cheap, and just look and feel interesting.

If you want a more premium feel that doesn't clash with design, a folio case is perfect. It protects both the screen and the corners, and a few can even flip out to act as a stand.

If you don't want anything between you and the phone, but still want a bit of defense in the pocket, a slipcover pouch is best.

If you've got the cash, though, it's worth buying a Composite case. These cases use a nice combination of silicone, hard plastic, and TPU to create the ultimate case. A good example is Otterbox. These cases do get expensive, but it's worth it.

* Composite (Otterbox & the like) - $20-40

## Silicone Case

If you've only got a buck, there's nothing better than silicone. It might look ugly and collect lint, but it definitely protects your phone from falls and scratches with springy rubber.

## Hard Plastic

If you want something solid that fits closely to the phone at a budget price, hard plastic is for you.

Note that plastic is generally less durable and does not resist shock well (usually the reason we have cases in the first place). Silicone is definitely a better bet.

## Thermoplastic Polyutherane (TPU case, S-Wave case)

A good balance between the springiness of silicone and the solid feel of plastic. TPU cases look like a premium item, fit well, and have a nice grip. 

TPU cases cost anywhere from $1-10, so if you're just out for a quality case at a decent price, this is the best.

## Folio Case

Commonly used with tablets, but are growing in popularity for phones. These are the cases with the best design, and give a level of luxury while staying cheap.

## Slipcover Pouch

## Composite

Composite cases put together the best qualities of each type of case to work around the flaws and create the ultimate defense for your smartphone. If you want the best and have money to burn, invest your money in a composite.

A good brand for composite cases is Otterbox.

## Plastic Film Full-body Covers

If you just want some defense against scratches, these full-body covers are for you. And although screen protectors are notorious for screwing with sensitivity and general stickiness, put some good money on decent covers and the issues will be mitigated.
