Custom ROMs can breathe new life into old phones, giving them more features, better performance, and new Android updates (which, as you may know, are a very big deal).

## Choosing a Custom ROM

The biggest forum for custom ROMs is [XDA-Developers](http://forum.xda-developers.com/). Just type the name of your device in the search bar, and go to the corresponding **Android Development** board.

From there, find a ROM that fits your needs. Once you find it, download the accompanying `.zip` file.

Notice that unless specifically stated in the ROM, most do not include the Play Store due to legal constraints. If you want them (definitely recommended), download the [Google Apps here.](http://goo.im/gapps/)

## Installing a Custom ROM

1. Place the ROM's `.zip` file somewhere easily accessible on your SDCard. You might also want to get the [Google Apps](http://goo.im/gapps/) `zip` file if you want the Play Store.

2. Enter recovery via the hboot menu(power off,power on while holding vol down. once in hboot,wait for white screen with text, then select recovery with power button and vol rocker)

3. Use the recovery menu on your phone to:
  * Make a backup of your stock,unrooted rom. Completely optional, but it's recommended in case problems happen.
  * If you are going to a new ROM (not updating an old one), it is strongly recommended to do a factory reset. Just select the factory reset option.
  * install both zips from sd card(chose your superuser file)
  * reboot
