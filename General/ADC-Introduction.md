## Why mod my phone?

That said, you should be wary of the risks, and make sure to avoid them. Some major mistakes could cause:

* Data Loss
* Soft-Bricking (a bit difficult to get out of)
* Hard-Bricking (Your phone is completely useless for the time being)

If you follow these instructions correctly, you will be fine. However, we take *absolutely no responsibility* for damaged devices or lost data as a result of following this guide or using any tools outlined in it.

Remember, **If you don't fully understand the implications, don't do it.**

## Why make a monolithic guide? Just go to the forums.

There are three reasons for creating one unified guidebook:

* **The entire community can work on one big guide, rather than a ton of small guides.** - The benefit of the wiki is that all members of the community can update and edit it as needed. It's great that guides already exist on the forums, but only the OP is able to edit the first post in a forum thread.  When that guy inevitably moves on or new developments occur, the guide will quickly become outdated, and perhaps even gravely dangerous.
* **The forums naturally become a mess.** - The reality is that forums are the wrong place for solid, malleable, community-editable guides. Forums may be great for quick discussion and actual development, but when it comes to providing updated repositories of common knowledge, it falls flat. We'll get honest here; the forums are naturally devolving into a barely readable mashup of guides, forum links, and outdated tutorials. This is extremely intimidating to newbies and difficult for even the most experienced users to grasp. We are creating a dangerous mess, where many a phone has been bricked due to confusing and outdated instructions. 

* **Clear, constant guidelines can be made for better readability.** - Android Modding requires diligence and a good background of knowledge to avoid the dreaded brick, and it doesn't help if the information you depend on is scattered or possibly outdated.  

## Why not just use the Official XDA Developers' Book?

While the Official XDA Book is a great example to follow, it was not created with much input from the XDA community, and as a dead-tree copy, it will slowly grow outdated with age. 

More importantly, it only details general instructions for Android and specifics for only a handful of devices. This is not a policy that works; Android is an incredibly diverse family of electronics, and methods differ greatly from device to device. It is impossible to create a single book that can aquedately explain a significant fraction of this universe, let alone all of them.

Therefore, the Development Codex is tasked with creating a unique guide for each and every device, consolidating all the innovations from the XDA Forums into one
