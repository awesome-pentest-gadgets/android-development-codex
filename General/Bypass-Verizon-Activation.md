Like all Verizon phones, you will have to make a special call to Verizon to activate your phone before using it. What you may not know is that there is a way to bypass this screen, if you don't have a contract with them.

When you see the screen that tells you to call to activate just hit **call to activate**, wait a few seconds, and press **end call** as soon as it starts calling. The Droid will beep three times if it "failed" successfully. 

Afterwards, press **Try Again** and repeat this 4 times. Sooner or later the Droid will give up and bypass activation. 

You can now use your Android with Wi-Fi as a conventional multimedia device, perhaps like an iPod Touch, without needing the Verizon service.
