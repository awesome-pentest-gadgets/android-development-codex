## General Android Guides

After getting superuser privileges and the ability to flash custom ROMs, we can now look at modifications common to all Android devices. These guides will be divided into three sections:

* **Usability Mods** - Recommended apps and tweaks that make your life easier.
* **Performance Mods** - Mods that give some energy to a tired old Android.
* **Deep System Tweaks** - (Usually included by modders inside Custom ROMs) Crazy stuff that happens under the system to give Android cool new features. Knowing some of these makes it easier to find out which custom ROM is right for you.
