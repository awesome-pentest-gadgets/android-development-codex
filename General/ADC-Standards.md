## How to write for the Android Development Codex

Editing a wiki might seem like a difficult prospect, and the Android Development Codex in particular uses a bunch of it's own extensions. Not to worry; we're guidemakers, and we will give you a great guide to "making guides".

### Basic Mediawiki Markup

First, you will have to **learn Mediawiki Markup**. This markup is designed to make it easy to use and learn for any ordinary person. And you don't have to learn or memorize everything; buttons are at the top for your convenience. Brush up on it before moving on.

Before editing any page, place a few comments in the Discussion page as fair warning. When editing a page, always make an effort to summarize your changes in the "reasons" box.

### Content Standards

* Stay professional. People need to trust us, and abusing dead memes or writing in l33tsp33k, while totally awesome, rarely inspires confidence. Expensive electronics are at stake here.
* Humor is encouraged (we need the comic relief). Just don't detract from the quality of the guide.
* Make guides clear and to the point. The shorter, the better; but no shorter. Use bullet points and numbered lists like there's no tomorrow.
* Make use of the *Codex Specific Features* found below. They really do help the reader along and make the guide something special!

### Codex Specific Features

The Codex uses some unique extensions that spice up the guide and enhance readability. Most of these were adopted from the Arch/Chakra Wikis.

* **Note, Warning, Tip boxes:** Used to highlight handy hints or important information.
* **Command Line Boxes:** Use this box to show that you want the user to pump commands through a terminal.
* **Physical Keys:** Use these if you want the reader to press specific keys in a combination.
* **Code formatting:** (inline code [ic], block code [bc], Content view code block [hc]) Use this if you want to show raw code. 

### Moving on?

If you've mastered all this, [[you can try to write your own guide for a brand new device|ADC Device Guide Standards]]. Good luck, and thanks for helping out on the Android Development Codex.

### Structural Components

* **Page Headers:** A box that holds a related icon and a short overview of the contents of a wikipage. Must be used on every page.
* **Device Infobox:** Used to give a quick summary of what

* **Article Summary/Map:** A nice navigation box and quick description to lead modders through every step of modding their device.
* **Article Status Templates:** Is a page outdated, inaccurate, or in need of repair? Tag it with these templates so we know what's wrong with which page.
* **Internationalization:** (i18n) It helps to reach Android modders in their native language. This system, adopted from the Chakra Wiki, is made to reach a new market of Android modders in need of good tips. 

### Undocumented Features

* **Frames:** [Frame], [Doubleframe] - Based on the tables in the iDroid Wiki front page. Makes it easy to frame a small wikipage in a aesthetically pleasing box. This should only be used on the front page.

## Device Guide Standards (notes)

### Content

* Make sure everything is up-to-date.
* Use wikilinks on terms and concepts that might be unfamiliar to the average layman (but only on first appearance!)
* Make content that is as reusable as possible. Import existing content where available.
* All guides must progress linearly. Don't get them mixed up!
* Clear, numbered steps and instructions to the point (make sure that anyone can understand it)
* Make required skills, setup, and files clear and accessible. Make sure that all files are saved somewhere safe with two mirrors. If the author requests no mirrors, leave mirror links as secret HTML comments just in case.

### Structure/Templates

* Stuff content common to all guides 
* Use Header boxes, to provide a pleasing, aesthetic intro; and for us to store category tags and other global mods
* Use of formatting "templates" (Note, warning, tip boxes, CLI, code, other advanced stuff)
* Infobox on the side (adopt the same one from XDA Wiki)
* Article Summary/Navigation bars, and  for sequenced guides
* Mark outdated or otherwise notable guides with quick tag templates
